_Study participants were stratified by age as young adults ($\leq$ 30 years), middle-aged (31 - 65 years) and elderly (> 65 years). Differences in demographic, socioeconomic, accident-related and mental health variables between the age strata were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test with $\eta^2$ effect size statistic. P values were corrected for multiple testing with false discovery rate method. Scores of panic (PHQ: patient health questionnaire), resilience (RS-13: 13-item resilience scale), reduced sense of coherence (SOC-9L: Leipzig 9-item sense of coherence scale), diminished life quality (EUROHIS-QOL 8: 8-item EUROHIS project quality of life scale) and of post-traumatic growth (PTGI: post-traumatic growth inventory) are presented in violin plots. Single observations are depicted as points. Red diamond with whiskers represent medians with interquartile ranges. Effect sizes and p values are indicated in the plot captions or in the plot Y axes.
