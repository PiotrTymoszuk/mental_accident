abstract = {Climbing has become an increasingly popular sport, and the number of accidents is increasing in parallel. We aim at describing the characteristics of climbing accidents leading to severe (multisystem) trauma using data from the International Alpine Trauma Registry (IATR) and at reporting the results of a systematic review of the literature on the epidemiology, injury pattern, severity and prevention of climbing accidents. We found that climbing accidents are a rare event, since approximately 10% of all mountain accidents are climbing related. Climbing accidents mainly affect young men and mostly lead to minor injuries. Fall is the most common mechanism of injury. Extremities are the most frequently injured body part. However, in multisystem climbing-related trauma, the predominant portion of injuries are to head/neck, chest and abdomen. The fatality rate of climbing accidents reported in the literature varies widely. Data on climbing accidents in general are very heterogeneous as they include different subspecialties of this sport and report accidents from different regions. A number of risk factors are accounted for in the literature. Appropriate training, preparation and adherence to safety standards are key in reducing the incidence and severity of climbing accidents.},

abstract = {Introduction: Professional mountain guides face significant occupational health risks, including injuries, accidents, environmental exposures, chronic musculoskeletal strain, and psychological stressors. This study aims to investigate these risks and their impact on the quality of life of a group of international British mountain guides. Methods: This self-reported online survey included demographics; acute and chronic occupational conditions; and questions on general health, lifestyle, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and quality of life based on the World Health Organization quality of life [WHOQOL-BREF] questionnaire. Results: Responses were received from 67 (32%) of the approached guides. Knee pain (75%), back and neck pain (62%), hand/upper extremity problems (51%), and lower limb injuries (49%) were the most commonly reported individual occupational health problems. Chronic eye problems were reported by 8%, and 5% reported skin cancer. Twenty-nine percent were on regular medications, which were mainly analgesics for chronic musculoskeletal complaints. Mountain guides have a healthy lifestyle, with lower rates of being overweight/obese, alcohol consumption, and smoking than the average UK population. Fourteen (61%) of the 23 guides responding to the PTSD questions reported experiencing life-threatening traumatic incidents, and 4 (25%) of this subgroup appear to have had some symptoms of PTSD. The quality of life assessment showed that the studied mountain guides have a high quality of life. Conclusions: Musculoskeletal problems are the main occupational health problems experienced by the study group. New findings include a low but important prevalence of ultraviolet radiation–associated conditions. One in 3 guides have experienced significant psychological trauma, and one quarter of these had symptoms of PTSD.},

abstract = {Background: The Covid-19 pandemic and related measures represent an enormous burden on mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal changes in psychological distress, loneliness, boredom, and resilience over the course of the pandemic and to examine the associations between resilience and extraversion at baseline (summer 2020) and psychological distress, loneliness, and boredom at 5-month-follow-up. Methods: Residents of Tyrol (≥18a) completed an online survey on psychological distress, loneliness, boredom, resilience, and extraversion by using the Brief-Symptom-Checklist, the Three-Item Loneliness Scale, the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale-Short Form (MSBS-SF), the Resilience Scale, and the Extraversion subscale of the Big Five Inventory. Results: Of the 961 baseline participants, 384 took part in the follow-up survey. The percentage of study participants with striking psychological distress remained the same. Similarly, resilience did not change from baseline to follow-up, whereas the number of those experiencing moderate loneliness increased significantly. In contrast, at follow-up, severe loneliness was detected in significantly less people. Boredom decreased significantly over time. A moderate negative association was detected between baseline resilience and psychological distress, loneliness, and boredom at follow-up, and a weak but still significant negative association between extraversion and these outcomes. Discussion: These findings indicate that a subset of the general population consistently suffers from high levels of psychological distress and point to the protective effects of resilience and extraversion in this context. They reemphasize the importance of prevention and mitigation strategies to address these public health problems.},

abstract = {Background: During the first 3 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal state of Tyrol, Austria had one of the strictest curfews in Austria and worldwide. The aim of the current study was to investigate the assumingly protective role of resilience and extraversion and its impact on mental health following such an uncertain and unpredictable situation. Methods: Between the first and the second wave of the pandemic, adult residents of Tyrol were invited to participate in an online survey. Next to the assessment of sociodemographic and COVID-19-related variables the Brief-Symptom-Checklist, the Three-Item Loneliness Scale, the Resilience Scaled, and the Big Five Inventory were used to assess psychological distress, loneliness, resilience, and extraversion. Mediation analysis was used to investigate the role of resilience and extraversion in the context of age-, sex-, and partnership- related differences in psychological distress and loneliness. Results: One hundred and forty-five participants took part in the survey (68.2% female). Overall, psychological distress and severe loneliness were more often detected in women and singles. They also were less resilient, while men and singles presented with a lower degree of extraversion. Study participants under the age of 30 experienced severe loneliness more frequently than older people, whereas psychological distress, resilience, and extraversion were comparable between age groups. Resilience significantly mediated the relationship between both study participants' sex and partnership situation on one hand and psychological distress and severe loneliness on the other. In addition, extraversion significantly mediated the relationship between participants' partnership situation and psychological distress. Discussion: Our findings suggest that women, singles, and young people may be particularly affected by the measures and sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions promoting resilience and extraversion among these groups are urgently needed to foster mental health. Ideally, they can be utilized at home in case of renewed mobility restrictions or quarantine in the future.},

Methods Nationally representative face-to face household surveys were conducted in Germany in 2006 (n = 5,036).   Results Normative data for the RS-11 were generated for men and women (53.7% female) and different age levels (mean age (SD) of 48.4 (18.0) years). Men had significantly higher mean scores compared with women (60.0 [SD = 10.2] vs. 59.3 [SD = 11.0]). Results of CFA supported a one-factor model of resilience. Self-esteem (standardized $\beta$ = .50) and life satisfaction (standardized $\beta$ =.20) were associated with resilience.   Conclusions The normative data provide a framework for the interpretation and comparisons of resilience with other populations. Results demonstrate a special importance of self-esteem in the understanding of resilience.},

abstract = {Background: For muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), no tissue biomarkers are available for clinical use to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Objective: To investigate how molecular subtypes impact pathological response and survival in patients receiving preoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Design, setting, and participants: Classification of a retrospective cohort of 149 patients was performed by tumor transcriptomic profiling and immunostaining. A cohort treated with radical cystectomy alone and public data sets were used for comparison and external validation. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Complete pathological response in the cystectomy specimen (ypT0N0) and survival were compared in predefined molecular subtypes. Differential gene expression and chemotherapy response were explored beyond molecular subtypes. Results and limitations: Patients with genomically unstable (GU) and urothelial-like (Uro) tumors had higher proportions of complete pathological response (16/31 [52%] and 17/54 [31%]), versus five out of 24 (21%) with the basal/squamous (Ba/Sq) subtype following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy. Molecular subtype was independently associated with improved survival for patients with GU tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11–0.79) and UroC tumors (HR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.14–0.94) compared with Ba/Sq tumors, adjusting for clinical stage. In addition, expression of the gene coding for osteopontin (SPP1) showed a subtype-dependent effect on chemotherapy response. Conclusions: Urothelial cancer of the luminal-like (GU and Uro) subtypes is more responsive to cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A second-generation of subtype-specific biomarkers, for example, SPP1, may be a way forward to develop a more precision-based treatment approach for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in MIBC. Patient summary: This study shows that tumor classification by gene expression profiling and molecular subtyping can identify patients who are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy before radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Together with other markers for response, molecular subtypes could have a role in selective administration of such chemotherapy.},

abstract = {In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of associated non-pharmaceutical containment measures, the need for continuous monitoring of the mental health of populations became apparent. When the pandemic hit Germany, a nationwide Mental Health Surveillance (MHS) was in conceptual development at Germany's governmental public health institute, the Robert Koch Institute. To meet the need for high-frequency reporting on population mental health we developed a prototype that provides monthly estimates of several mental health indicators with smoothing splines. We used data from the telephone surveys German Health Update (GEDA) and COVID-19 vaccination rate monitoring in Germany (COVIMO). This paper provides a description of the highly automated data pipeline that produces time series data for graphical representations, including details on data collection, data preparation, calculation of estimates, and output creation. Furthermore, statistical methods used in the weighting algorithm, model estimations for moving three-month predictions as well as smoothing techniques are described and discussed. Generalized additive modelling with smoothing splines best meets the desired criteria with regard to identifying general time trends. We show that the prototype is suitable for a population-based high-frequency mental health surveillance that is fast, flexible, and able to identify variation in the data over time. The automated and standardized data pipeline can also easily be applied to other health topics or other surveys and survey types. It is highly suitable as a data processing tool for the efficient continuous health surveillance required in fast-moving times of crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic.},

Main results were low frequencies of TEs (24%) and PTSD (2.9%). Older participants (>60 years) reported significantly more TEs and more posttraumatic symptoms, whereas there was no significant difference in PTSD prevalence. A third of the subjects diagnosed with PTSD were found positive for depressive syndromes, and 27% were found positive for somatization syndrome. The results show that TEs and posttraumatic symptoms are frequent in senior citizens and thus have to be considered when treating older patients with mental health conditions.

Lifetime, past-12-month, and past 6-month PTSD prevalence using the Same Event definition for DSM-5 was 8.3%, 4.7%, and 3.8% respectively. All 6 DSM-5 prevalence estimates were slightly lower than their DSM-IV counterparts, although only 2 of these differences were statistically significant. DSM-5 PTSD prevalence was higher among women than among men, and prevalence increased with greater traumatic event exposure. Major reasons individuals met DSM-IV criteria, but not DSM-5 criteria were the exclusion of nonaccidental, nonviolent deaths from Criterion A, and the new requirement of at least 1 active avoidance symptom. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.},

abstract = {Background Traumatic events are common globally; however, comprehensive population-based cross-national data on the epidemiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the paradigmatic trauma-related mental disorder, are lacking. Methods Data were analyzed from 26 population surveys in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys. A total of 71 083 respondents ages 18+ participated. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed exposure to traumatic events as well as 30-day, 12-month, and lifetime PTSD. Respondents were also assessed for treatment in the 12 months preceding the survey. Age of onset distributions were examined by country income level. Associations of PTSD were examined with country income, world region, and respondent demographics. Results The cross-national lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 3.9% in the total sample and 5.6% among the trauma exposed. Half of respondents with PTSD reported persistent symptoms. Treatment seeking in high-income countries (53.5%) was roughly double that in low-lower middle income (22.8%) and upper-middle income (28.7%) countries. Social disadvantage, including younger age, female sex, being unmarried, being less educated, having lower household income, and being unemployed, was associated with increased risk of lifetime PTSD among the trauma exposed. Conclusions PTSD is prevalent cross-nationally, with half of all global cases being persistent. Only half of those with severe PTSD report receiving any treatment and only a minority receive specialty mental health care. Striking disparities in PTSD treatment exist by country income level. Increasing access to effective treatment, especially in low- and middle-income countries, remains critical for reducing the population burden of PTSD.},

abstract = {Objective The present study was designed to assess the frequency of trauma exposure, the prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder, comorbid symptoms, and sense of coherence (SOC) in Swiss mountain guides. Method All mountain guides (n=1347) were surveyed using of the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), and the Sense of Coherence Self-Rating Scale (SOC-29). Results Although Swiss mountain guides are exposed to many traumatic situations, the prevalence rate of PTSD is very low (2.7%), and their SOC total scores are high (157.9±18.4). Subgroups differentiated by the extent of traumatic stress symptoms differ significantly in SOC and GHQ total scores. Regression analysis showed SOC total score to be a significant predictor, although it only accounted for 1% of the variance in the number of PTSD symptoms endorsed. Conclusion The low prevalence rate of PTSD is not in line with findings in other high-risk populations for PTSD. SOC seems to be a marker for psychological health rather than a protective factor against PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Cheung2017,
abstract = {Background: In public health monitoring of young people it is critical to understand the effects of selective non-response, in particular when a controversial topic is involved like substance abuse or sexual behaviour. Research that is dependent upon voluntary subject participation is particularly vulnerable to sampling bias. As respondents whose participation is hardest to elicit on a voluntary basis are also more likely to report risk behaviour, this potentially leads to underestimation of risk factor prevalence. Inviting adolescents to participate in a home-sent postal survey is a typical voluntary recruitment strategy with high non-response, as opposed to mandatory participation during school time. This study examines the extent to which prevalence estimates of adolescent health-related characteristics are biased due to different sampling methods, and whether this also biases within-subject analyses. Methods: Cross-sectional datasets collected in 2011 in Twente and IJsselland, two similar and adjacent regions in the Netherlands, were used. In total, 9360 youngsters in a mandatory sample (Twente) and 1952 youngsters in a voluntary sample (IJsselland) participated in the study. To test whether the samples differed on health-related variables, we conducted both univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses controlling for any demographic difference between the samples. Additional multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to examine moderating effects of sampling method on associations between health-related variables. Results: As expected, females, older individuals, as well as individuals with higher education levels, were over-represented in the voluntary sample, compared to the mandatory sample. Respondents in the voluntary sample tended to smoke less, consume less alcohol (ever, lifetime, and past four weeks), have better mental health, have better subjective health status, have more positive school experiences and have less sexual intercourse than respondents in the mandatory sample. No moderating effects were found for sampling method on associations between variables. Conclusions: This is one of first studies to provide strong evidence that voluntary recruitment may lead to a strong non-response bias in health-related prevalence estimates in adolescents, as compared to mandatory recruitment. The resulting underestimation in prevalence of health behaviours and well-being measures appeared large, up to a four-fold lower proportion for self-reported alcohol consumption. Correlations between variables, though, appeared to be insensitive to sampling bias.},

abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

This randomized, open-label, phase 3 study compared nivolumab with everolimus in patients with renal-cell carcinoma who had received previous treatment. METHODS A total of 821 patients with advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma for which they had received previous treatment with one or two regimens of antiangiogenic therapy were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive 3 mg of nivolumab per kilogram of body weight intravenously every 2 weeks or a 10-mg everolimus tablet orally once daily. The primary end point was overall survival. The secondary end points included the objective response rate and safety. RESULTS The median overall survival was 25.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.8 to not estimable) with nivolumab and 19.6 months (95% CI, 17.6 to 23.1) with everolimus. The hazard ratio for death with nivolumab versus everolimus was 0.73 (98.5% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P=0.002), which met the prespecified criterion for superiority (P≤0.0148). The objective response rate was greater with nivolumab than with everolimus (25% vs. 5%; odds ratio, 5.98 [95% CI, 3.68 to 9.72]; P<0.001). The median progression-free survival was 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) with nivolumab and 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.5) with everolimus (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03; P=0.11). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19% of the patients receiving nivolumab and in 37% of the patients receiving everolimus; the most common event with nivolumab was fatigue (in 2% of the patients), and the most common event with everolimus was anemia (in 8%). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with previously treated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, overall survival was longer and fewer grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred with nivolumab than with everolimus.

@article{Strobl2007,
abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Here, in order to investigate the metabolic alterations in response to immune checkpoint blockade, we comprehensively profile serum metabolites in advanced melanoma and renal cell carcinoma patients treated with nivolumab, an antibody against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1). We identify serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratio increases as an adaptive resistance mechanism associated with worse overall survival. This advocates for patient stratification and metabolic monitoring in immunotherapy clinical trials including those combining PD1 blockade with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase   (IDO/TDO) inhibitors. Immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy has achieved success in a subset of patients. Here the authors profiled about 200 relevant metabolites in patient serum samples from three independent immunotherapy trials and found the serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratio increases to be associated with worse overall survival.},

Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.},

abstract = {The possibility of positive psychological changes after cancer, namely, posttraumatic growth, is a growing field of research. Identifying personality traits and coping strategies related to posttraumatic growth may help find vulnerable individuals as well as promote helpful coping strategies to help more patients make positive changes at an early stage. The aim of this systematic literature review is to provide an overview of the quantitative data on coping strategies and personality traits associated with posttraumatic growth in patients with cancer and cancer survivors as well as the methods used in included studies. A systematic literature search was conducted using five databases (PubMed, PubPsych, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and PSYNDEXplus). The 70 reports of included studies assessed posttraumatic growth using questionnaires in a sample of patients with cancer or survivors. In addition, associations with a personality trait or coping strategy had to be examined cross-sectionally or longitudinally. All 1698 articles were screened for titles and abstracts by two authors, after which disputed articles were reviewed by a third author. Afterwards, articles were screened for full texts. Most studies had a cross-sectional design and used a sample of patients with breast cancer. Coping strategies have been researched more than personality factors. The personality traits of resilience, hardiness, dispositional positive affectivity, and dispositional gratitude seem to be related to posttraumatic growth, while the Big Five personality traits (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) have been less researched and/or seem to be unrelated. The use of social support, religious coping, positive reframing, and reflection during illness as coping strategies seems to be related to posttraumatic growth. The findings can be used for the development of interventions. Future studies should investigate associations longitudinally.},

abstract = {We estimate the cumulative occurrence of traumatic events and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria, in a high-risk sample of young people in urban United States. The epidemiological sample (n = 2,311) was recruited in 1985-1986 at entry into first grade of a public school system of a large mid-Atlantic city. Participants were interviewed about history of trauma and PTSD in 2000-2002 when their mean age was 21 years (n = 1,698). We found that the lifetime occurrence of assaultive violence was 62.6% in males and 33.7% in females. The risk of assaultive violence in males (but not females) varied by childhood area of residence within the city; the occurrence of other traumas did not vary by area of childhood residence. Females had a higher risk of PTSD than males following assaultive violence (odds ratio = 4.0, 95% confidence interval 2.0-8.3), but not following other traumas. A comparison of the results from this largely inner-city sample with the results from a recent study of a largely suburban sample in another region of the United States in which the same criteria and measures of trauma and PTSD were used suggested the possibility that males' risk for assaultive violence and females' risk for PTSD following exposure to assaultive violence might vary by characteristics of the social environment.},

abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown thai the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification, node positive breast cancer survival and mammography experience are re-analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and Interface Foundation of North America.},

Furthermore, other personality characteristics may increase the risk of developing post-traumatic stress symptoms following a COVID-19 infection. This study aimed to assess personality traits, alexithymia, dissociation, anxiety, and depression in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and the impact of these variables on the presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. Five hundred and six participants completed a battery of standardized questionnaires. All the scales used in this study are valid and reliable measures of their respective constructs. Results showed that high levels of alexithymia, dissociation, anxiety, and depression statistically significantly predicted the three main clusters of PTSD symptoms (avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal) in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Furthermore, negative affectivity and psychoticism significantly predicted PTSD symptoms in our sample. Finally, individuals hospitalized by COVID-19 are more at risk of developing intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than those who never needed hospital care. Our findings are a valuable contribution in identifying the main risk factors of psychological distress related to COVID-19 to address the long-term mental health needs of people who have experienced the disease.},

First, we introduce a pooled centroids formulation of the multiclass LDA predictor function, in which the relative weights of Mahalanobis-transformed predictors are given by correlation-adjusted t-scores (cat scores). Second, for feature selection we propose thresholding cat scores by controlling false nondiscovery rates (FNDR). Third, training of the classifier is based on James–Stein shrinkage estimates of correlations and variances, where regularization parameters are chosen analytically without resampling. Overall, this results in an effective and computationally inexpensive framework for high-dimensional prediction with natural feature selection. The proposed shrinkage discriminant procedures are implemented in the R package “sda” available from the R repository CRAN.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * *, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Some of these antigens are encoded by genes MAGE-1, MAGE-3, and BAGE, which are expressed in a large fraction of tumors of various histological types but are silent in normal adult tissues with the exception of testis. We report here the identification of the gene coding for MZ2-F, another antigen recognized by autologous CTL on MZ2-MEL cells. This gene, which was named GAGE-l, is not related to any presently known gene. It belongs to a family of genes that are expressed in a variety of tumors but not in normal tissues, except for the testis. Antigenic peptide YILPRPRRY, which is encoded by GAGE-l, is recognized by anti-MZ2-F CTL on class I molecule HLA-Cw6. The two genes of the GAGE family that code for this peptide, namely GAGE-1 and GAGE-2, are expressed in a significant proportion of melanomas (24%), sarcomas (25%), non-small cell lung cancers (19%), head and neck tumors (19%), and bladder tumors (12%). About 50% of melanoma patients carry on their tumor at least one of the presently defined antigens encoded by the MAGE, BAGE, and GAGE genes. {\textcopyright} 1995, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A timely determination of the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prerequisite for efficient service delivery and prevention. We provide a risk estimate tool allowing a calculation of individuals' PTSD likelihood from early predictors. Members of the International Consortium to Predict PTSD (ICPP) shared individual participants' item-level data from ten longitudinal studies of civilian trauma survivors admitted to acute care centers in six countries. Eligible participants (N=2,473) completed an initial clinical assessment within 60 days of trauma exposure, and at least one follow-up assessment 4-15 months later. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) evaluated PTSD symptom severity and diagnostic status at each assessment. Participants' education, prior lifetime trauma exposure, marital status and socio-economic status were assessed and harmonized across studies. The study's main outcome was the likelihood of a follow-up PTSD given early predictors. The prevalence of follow-up PTSD was 11.8% (9.2% for male participants and 16.4% for females). A logistic model using early PTSD symptom severity (initial CAPS total score) as a predictor produced remarkably accurate estimates of follow-up PTSD (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.976). Adding respondents' female gender, lower education, and exposure to prior interpersonal trauma to the model yielded higher PTSD likelihood estimates, with similar model accuracy (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.941). The current model could be adjusted for other traumatic circumstances and accommodate risk factors not captured by the ICPP (e.g., biological, social). In line with their use in general medicine, risk estimate models can inform clinical choices in psychiatry. It is hoped that quantifying individuals' PTSD risk will be a first step towards systematic prevention of the disorder.},

@article{Ross-Macdonald2021,
abstract = {Background Nivolumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting the programmed death-1 receptor that improves survival in a subset of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In contrast to other tumor types that respond to immunotherapy, factors such as programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) status and tumor mutational burden show limited predictive utility in ccRCC. To address this gap, we report here the first molecular characterization of nivolumab response using paired index lesions, before and during treatment of metastatic ccRCC.

Methods We analyzed gene expression and T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality using lesion-paired biopsies provided in the CheckMate 009 trial and integrated the results with their PD-L1/CD4/CD8 status, genomic mutation status and serum cytokine assays. Statistical tests included linear mixed models, logistic regression models, Fisher's exact test, and Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test.

Results We identified transcripts related to response, both at baseline and on therapy, including several that are amenable to peripheral bioassays or to therapeutic intervention. At both timepoints, response was positively associated with T-cell infiltration but not associated with TCR clonality, and some non-Responders were highly infiltrated. Lower baseline T-cell infiltration correlated with elevated transcription of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling components and hypoxia-regulated genes, including the Treg chemoattractant CCL28. On treatment, analysis of the non-responding patients whose tumors were highly T-cell infiltrated suggests association of the RIG-I-MDA5 pathway in their nivolumab resistance. We also analyzed our data using previous transcriptional classifications of ccRCC and found they concordantly identified a molecular subtype that has enhanced nivolumab response but is sunitinib-resistant.

Conclusion Our study describes molecular characteristics of response and resistance to nivolumab in patients with metastatic ccRCC, potentially impacting patient selection and first-line treatment decisions.

abstract = {Background: The proportion of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that remain undiagnosed may be substantial. Without an accurate diagnosis, these patients may lack PTSD-targeted treatments and experience adverse health outcomes. This study used a machine learning approach to identify and describe civilian patients likely to have undiagnosed PTSD in the US commercial population. Methods: The IBM{\textregistered} MarketScan{\textregistered} Commercial Subset (10/01/2015–12/31/2018) was used. A random forest machine learning model was developed and trained to differentiate between patients with and without PTSD using non–trauma-based features. The model was applied to patients for whom PTSD status could not be confirmed to identify individuals likely and unlikely to have undiagnosed PTSD. Patient characteristics, symptoms and complications potentially related to PTSD, treatments received, healthcare costs, and healthcare resource utilization were described separately for patients with PTSD (Actual Positive PTSD cohort), patients likely to have PTSD (Likely PTSD cohort), and patients without PTSD (Without PTSD cohort). Results: A total of 44,342 patients were classified in the Actual Positive PTSD cohort, 5683 in the Likely PTSD cohort, and 2,074,471 in the Without PTSD cohort. While several symptoms/comorbidities were similar between the Actual Positive and Likely PTSD cohorts, others, including depression and anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts/actions, and substance use, were more common in the Likely PTSD cohort, suggesting that certain symptoms may be exacerbated among those without a formal diagnosis. Mean per-patient-per-6-month healthcare costs were similar between the Actual Positive and Likely PTSD cohorts ($11,156 and $11,723) and were higher than those of the Without PTSD cohort ($3616); however, cost drivers differed between cohorts, with the Likely PTSD cohort experiencing more inpatient admissions and less outpatient visits than the Actual Positive PTSD cohort. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the lack of a PTSD diagnosis and targeted management of PTSD may result in a greater burden among undiagnosed patients and highlights the need for increased awareness of PTSD in clinical practice and among the civilian population.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to validate the German version of the "Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)". The PHQ has been developed to screen for mental disorders in primary care, using diagnostic criteria from the DSM-IV. Three hundred and fifty-seven medical outpatients and 171 psychosomatic outpatients completed the PHQ and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the latter serving as criterion standard. Acceptability of the PHQ as the screening instrument was investigated for physicians and patients. For the diagnosis of major depressive disorder, the PHQ showed excellent criterion validity (medical patients: sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 86%). Good operating characteristics were also found for the diagnosis of panic disorder. The use of the PHQ was well accepted by more than 90% of both physicians and patients. Overall, the PHQ is a valid, effective, and well accepted diagnostic tool for use in research and clinical practice. Its' application in primary care and other clinical settings might contribute to better diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.},

@article{Hilborn2017,
abstract = {Sex steroid hormones such as estrogens and androgens are involved in the development and differentiation of the breast tissue. The activity and concentration of sex steroids is determined by the availability from the circulation, and on local conversion. This conversion is primarily mediated by aromatase, steroid sulfatase, and 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. In postmenopausal women, this is the primary source of estrogens in the breast. Up to 70-80% of all breast cancers express the estrogen receptor-a, responsible for promoting the growth of the tissue. Further, 60-80% express the androgen receptor, which has been shown to have tissue protective effects in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, and a more ambiguous response in estrogen receptor negative breast cancers. In this review, we summarize the function and clinical relevance in cancer for 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1, which facilitates the reduction of estrone to estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone to androstendiol and dihydrotestosterone to 3a- and 3$\beta$-diol as well as 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 2 which mediates the oxidation of estradiol to estrone, testosterone to androstenedione and androstendiol to dehydroepiandrosterone. The expression of 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1 and 2 alone and in combination has been shown to predict patient outcome, and inhibition of 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1 has been proposed to be a prime candidate for inhibition in patients who develop aromatase inhibitor resistance or in combination with aromatase inhibitors as a first line treatment. Here we review the status of inhibitors against 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 1. In addition, we review the involvement of 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 4, 5, 7, and 14 in breast cancer.},

abstract = {Objective: The present study aimed to assess the frequency of trauma exposure, the prevalence of possible post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the extent of resilience, and sense of coherence among personnel of the Swiss alpine rescue association (ARS). Methods: Using a trilingual online survey approach, 465 mountain rescuers of the ARS were surveyed using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL-5), the Resilience Scale 13 and 14 (RS-13/-14), the Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS-10), the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12), the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Sense of Coherence Scale 13 (SOC-13), and the Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS). Results: Although the rate of mountain rescuers having witnessed or experienced a traumatic event was high (71%), the prevalence of possible PTSD was low (0.9%). The sample showed high resilience and high sense of coherence. Resilience was positively correlated with work experience. Low perceived stress and high sense of coherence predicted resilience. The severity of PTSD symptoms was mainly predicted by low sense of coherence. Sense of coherence mediated the interaction between resilience and severity of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: The findings suggest that resilience and sense of coherence are indicative for the low prevalence of possible PTSD among mountain rescuers, and may therefore represent valuable screening and training parameters for mountain rescue personnel.},

abstract = {Background: Survey research including multiple health indicators requires brief indices for use in cross-cultural studies, which have, however, rarely been tested in terms of their psychometric quality. Recently, the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index was developed as an adaptation of the WHOQOL-100 and the WHOQOL-BREF. The aim of the current study was to test the psychometric properties of the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index. Methods: In a survey on 4849 European adults, the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index was assessed across 10 countries, with equal samples adjusted for selected sociodemographic data. Participants were also investigated with a chronic condition checklist, measures on general health perception, mental health, health-care utilization and social support. Results: Findings indicated good internal consistencies across a range of countries, showing acceptable convergent validity with physical and mental health measures, and the measure discriminates well between individuals that report having a longstanding condition and healthy individuals across all countries. Differential item functioning was less frequently observed in those countries that were geographically and culturally closer to the UK, but acceptable across all countries. A universal one-factor structure with a good fit in structural equation modelling analyses (SEM) was identified with, however, limitations in model fit for specific countires. Conclusions: The short EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index showed good cross-cultural field study performance and a satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity, and can therefore be recommended for use in public health research. In future studies the measure should also be tested in multinational clinical studies, particularly in order to test its sensitivity. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

In the era of immune-based cancer therapeutics, redirecting our immune cells to target these tumour-specific antigens has become even more relevant. Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) are a class of antigens with an expression specific to the testis and cancer cells. CTAs have also been demonstrated to be expressed in a wide variety of cancers. Due to their frequency and specificity of expression in a multitude of cancers, CTAs have been particularly attractive as cancer-specific therapeutic targets. There is now a rapid expansion of CTAs being identified and many studies have been conducted to correlate CTA expression with cancer and therapy-resistant phenotypes. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of clinical trials involving using some of these CTAs as molecular targets in pharmacological and immune-targeted therapeutics for various cancers. This review will summarise the current knowledge of the biology of known CTAs in tumorigenesis and the regulation of CTA genes. CTAs as molecular targets and the therapeutic implications of these CTA-targeted anticancer strategies will also be discussed.},

These patients are at substantial psychiatric risk, with approximately 10–20% developing one or more disorders, including anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)2–4. At present, no accurate method exists to predict the development of PTSD symptoms upon ED admission after trauma5. Accurate risk identification at the point of treatment by ED services is necessary to inform the targeted deployment of existing treatment6–9 to mitigate subsequent psychopathology in high-risk populations10,11. This work reports the development and validation of an algorithm for prediction of post-traumatic stress course over 12 months using two independently collected prospective cohorts of trauma survivors from two level 1 emergency trauma centers, which uses routinely collectible data from electronic medical records, along with brief clinical assessments of the patient's immediate stress reaction. Results demonstrate externally validated accuracy to discriminate PTSD risk with high precision. While the predictive algorithm yields useful reproducible results on two independent prospective cohorts of ED patients, future research should extend the generalizability to the broad, clinically heterogeneous ED population under conditions of routine medical care.},

abstract = {Research divides and reports negative associations between negative (pathogenic; e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder; PTSD) and positive (salutogenic; e.g., posttraumatic growth, resilience) psychological responses to trauma. This study elaborates prior research by casting resilience as a trait rather than state. Participants with varied exposure levels (n=500) completed measures of resilience, trauma history, PTSD, and posttraumatic growth. Results of structural equation modeling with LISREL showed that trauma increased PTSD and growth levels, whereas resilience was associated positively with growth and negatively with PTSD. It is concluded that salutogenic and pathological responses to trauma show differential associations with trait resilience. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this article we will describe the evaluation of Antonovsky's 29-items Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-29) in a large community sample (n = 2.005) of the German population and the development of the Leipzig Short Scale (SOC-L9), which consists of only 9 items. The SOC-29 has a high internal consistency ($\alpha$ = 0.92), however, the SOC-subscales (comprehensibility, manageability, meaningfulness) were correlated with each other. A principal component factor analysis did not identify the 3-factor structure of the SOC-Scale. It appears that the best solution consists of one global factor. The newly developed SOC-L9, conceptualized as an unidimensional scale, is a reliable and valid instrument, which allows to assess the SOC economically. In our study the Sense of Coherence depended on age and gender. Women and older people reported a lower SOC. Furthermore we found significant associations between SOC and different subjective health measures. A high SOC was associated with both a lower extent of subjective body complaints and somatoform symptoms and with minor health-related problems in daily living.},

abstract = {Objective: Physical activity (PA) in an outdoor environment has been shown to exert positive effects on mental well-being beyond those found for PA indoors. The specific effect of an alpine environment has not been investigated so far. Here we evaluate the association of PA in an alpine environment with resilience and quality of life (QOL) in patients with psychosomatic disorders and controls. Methods: 194 patients with psychosomatic disorders (mostly somatoform disorder and major depressive syndrome) and 326 healthy controls were included in this web-based cross-sectional study. PA was scored using an adapted version of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire including the environmental aspect (indoor, outdoor, alpine environment). Resilience was assessed using the Resilience Scale-13, QOL using the WHOQOL-BREF. Group comparisons, correlation and mediation analyses were performed. Results: Patients showed significantly lower levels of resilience (p < 0.001) and QOL (p < 0.001) compared to controls. PA in an alpine environment was associated with resilience (patients: r = 0.35, p < 0.001; controls r = 0.18, p < 0.001). There were no significant associations between PA in other environments (outdoor or indoor) and resilience. PA in all three environments correlated with subcategories of QOL. The effect of PA in an alpine environment on QOL was partly mediated by resilience in patients (68% of total effect mediated, p < 0.001) and controls (49% mediated, p = 0.006). Conclusion: There is a positive effect of PA in an alpine environment on mental health beyond that of physical activity itself. Preventive and therapeutic programs should thus include physical activity, but also take additional benefits of natural environments into account.},

@article{Benjet2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Considerable research has documented that exposure to traumatic events has negative effects on physical and mental health. Much less research has examined the predictors of traumatic event exposure. Increased understanding of risk factors for exposure to traumatic events could be of considerable value in targeting preventive interventions and anticipating service needs.
METHOD: General population surveys in 24 countries with a combined sample of 68 894 adult respondents across six continents assessed exposure to 29 traumatic event types. Differences in prevalence were examined with cross-tabulations. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine whether traumatic event types clustered into interpretable factors. Survival analysis was carried out to examine associations of sociodemographic characteristics and prior traumatic events with subsequent exposure.
RESULTS: Over 70% of respondents reported a traumatic event; 30.5% were exposed to four or more. Five types - witnessing death or serious injury, the unexpected death of a loved one, being mugged, being in a life-threatening automobile accident, and experiencing a life-threatening illness or injury - accounted for over half of all exposures. Exposure varied by country, sociodemographics and history of prior traumatic events. Being married was the most consistent protective factor. Exposure to interpersonal violence had the strongest associations with subsequent traumatic events.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the near ubiquity of exposure, limited resources may best be dedicated to those that are more likely to be further exposed such as victims of interpersonal violence. Identifying mechanisms that account for the associations of prior interpersonal violence with subsequent trauma is critical to develop interventions to prevent revictimization.},

abstract = {The possible burden of participating in trauma research is an important topic for Ethical Committees (EC's), Review Boards (RB's) and researchers. However, to what extent research on trauma is more burdensome than non-trauma research is unknown. Little is known about which factors explain respondents evaluations on the burden: to what extent are they trauma-related or dependent on other factors such as personality and how respondents evaluate research in general? Data of a large probability based multi-wave internet panel, with surveys on politics and values, personality and health in 2009 and 2011, and a survey on trauma in 2012 provided the unique opportunity to address these questions. Results among respondents confronted with these events in the past 2 years (N = 950) showed that questions on trauma were significantly and systematically evaluated as less pleasant (enjoyed less), more difficult, but also stimulated respondents to think about things more than almost all previous non-trauma surveys. Yet, the computed effect sizes indicated that the differences were (very) small and often meaningless. No differences were found between users and non-users of mental services, in contrast to posttraumatic stress symptoms. Evaluations of the burden of previous surveys in 2011 on politics and values, personality and health most strongly, systematically and independently predicted the burden of questions on trauma, and not posttraumatic stress symptoms, event-related coping self-efficacy and personality factors. For instance, multiple linear regression analyses showed that 30% of the variance of how (un)pleasant questions on trauma and life-events were evaluated, was explained by how (un)pleasant the 3 surveys in 2011 were evaluated, in contrast to posttraumatic stress symptoms (not significant) and coping self-efficacy (5%). Findings question why EC's, RB's and researchers should be more critical of the possible burden of trauma research than of the possible burden of other non-trauma research. {\textcopyright} 2013 van der Velden et al.},

abstract = {For a decade, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program collected clinicopathologic annotation data along with multi-platform molecular profiles of more than 11,000 human tumors across 33 different cancer types. TCGA clinical data contain key features representing the democratized nature of the data collection process. To ensure proper use of this large clinical dataset associated with genomic features, we developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR), which includes four major clinical outcome endpoints. In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type. These TCGA-CDR findings appear to be consistent with cancer genomics studies independent of the TCGA effort and provide opportunities for investigating cancer biology using clinical correlates at an unprecedented scale. Analysis of clinicopathologic annotations for over 11,000 cancer patients in the TCGA program leads to the generation of TCGA Clinical Data Resource, which provides recommendations of clinical outcome endpoint usage for 33 cancer types.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {At the late 1940s, 17$\beta$-HSD1 was discovered as the first member of the 17$\beta$-HSD family with its gene cloned. The three-dimensional structure of human 17$\beta$-HSD1 is the first example of any human steroid converting enzyme. The human enzyme's structure and biological function have thus been studied extensively in the last two decades. In humans, the enzyme is expressed in placenta, ovary, endometrium and breast. The high activity of estrogen activation provides the basis of 17$\beta$-HSD1's implication in estrogen-dependent diseases, such as breast cancer, endometriosis and non-small cell lung carcinomas. Its dual function in estrogen activation and androgen inactivation has been revealed in molecular and breast cancer cell levels, significantly stimulating the proliferation of such cells. The enzyme's overexpression in breast cancer was demonstrated by clinical samples. Inhibition of human 17$\beta$-HSD1 led to xenograft tumor shrinkage. Unfortunately, through decades of studies, there is still no drug using the enzyme's inhibitors available. This is due to the difficulty to get rid of the estrogenic activity of its inhibitors, which are mostly estrogen analogues. New non-steroid inhibitors for the enzyme provide new hope for non-estrogenic inhibitors of the enzyme.},

The purpose of this review is to explore recent research examining potential gender- and sex-based contributors to sex differences in PTSD. Recent Findings: We identified 19 studies published since 2015. Masculinity is inconclusively associated with PTSD, but masculine ideals and masculine gender role stress are positively associated with PTSD. Among the sex-related factors, testosterone, oestradiol, progesterone, and ALLO/5$\alpha$-progesterone ratio are believed to be involved in the development of PTSD. These factors likely affect PTSD risk directly and through epigenetic mechanisms. Summary: Findings suggest that gender and sex have multiple ways of affecting PTSD, including gender roles, genetic predisposition, and hormonal influences. These factors work together to put women at a particular risk of developing PTSD. By conducting more research, we may improve prediction, prevention, and treatment of PTSD.},

Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C plus plus, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer, its causes remain unknown. The most common conditions known to be associated with testicular cancer are cryptorchidism, infertility, and overexposure to pesticides or radiation. Recent studies also indicate hormones may play a crucial role in testicular tumorigenesis. Our studies show that about half of the male transgenic mice overexpressing aromatase in testis were infertile and/or had larger than normal testicles. Gross pathology and histological analysis showed the mice to have Leydig cell tumors, unilaterally or bilaterally. Serum estradiol levels for transgenic mice were at least twice as high as those for nontransgenic mice. Expression of aromatase and estrogen receptor were also very high in testicular tissue of transgenic mice compared to non-transgenic mice. Consistent with increased estrogenic activity in the testicular tissue, we also saw an increase in the levels of genes involved in cell cycle that are regulated by the estrogen. To obtain a better understanding of the biological significance of testicular tumorigenesis, a reliable animal model is necessary to clarify the mechanisms and correlations associated with human cancers. Here we describe such a model, which shows that overexpression of aromatase results in increased estrogen production and a changed hormone milieu, leading to the induction of testicular cancer (Leydig cell tumors). This predictable and useful model is a potential tool for the study of testicular tumorigenesis, hormonal carcinogenesis, synergistic action of other carcinogens on hormone-induced tumors, and tumor dependency on endocrine factors.},

abstract = {Recursive partitioning methods have become popular and widely used tools for nonparametric regression and classification in many scientific fields. Especially random forests, which can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine, and bioinformatics within the past few years. High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application. Application of the methods is illustrated with freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Secondary interventions are implemented within a short interval following the occurrence of traumatic events with the purpose of preventing the onset of PTSD. Objective Analyze the results of studies that assessed post-trauma interventions in adults aimed at preventing the onset of PTSD or symptoms related to PTSD. Methods We performed literature searches using the search expression [(Early intervention OR secondary prevention) AND (Post traumatic stress disorder OR PTSD)] for articles published until October 2016. Among the references found, 29 fulfilled the selection criteria established for the review. Data were divided and analyzed according to the type of intervention: pharmacological or psychological. Results Psychological measures used in the studies lack homogeneity regarding the type of intervention and the assessment of intervention outcomes. Pharmacological interventions were less frequent and findings require replication, together with an expansion in the types of substances investigated. In general, many of the studies reviewed suggest that both pharmacological and psychological interventions are effective in the prevention of PTSD. Discussion Future trials should be focused on determining the best interventions for the secondary prevention of PTSD. The combination of psychological and pharmacological interventions for post-trauma patients poses opportunities and challenges that remain unexplored.},

abstract = {Objective: Somatization is prevalent in primary care and is associated with substantial functional impairment and healthcare utilization. However, instruments for identifying and monitoring somatic symptoms are few in number and not widely used. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief measure of the severity of somatic symptoms. Methods: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-15 comprises 15 somatic symptoms from the PHQ, each symptom scored from 0 ("not bothered at all") to 2 ("bothered a lot"). The PHQ-15 was administered to 6000 patients in eight general internal medicine and family practice clinics and seven obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Outcomes included functional status as assessed by the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-20), self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Results: As PHQ-15 somatic symptom severity increased, there was a substantial stepwise decrement in functional status on all six SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. PHQ-15 scores of 5, 10, 15, represented cutoff points for low, medium, and high somatic symptom severity, respectively. Somatic and depressive symptom severity had differential effects on outcomes. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. Conclusions: The PHQ-15 is a brief, self-administered questionnaire that may be useful in screening for somatization and in monitoring somatic symptom severity in clinical practice and research.},

Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters. The work highlights the use of UMAP for improved visualization and interpretation of single-cell data.},

@article{Strobl2008,
abstract = {Background: Random forests are becoming increasingly popular in many scientific fields because they can cope with "small n large p" problems, complex interactions and even highly correlated predictor variables. Their variable importance measures have recently been suggested as screening tools for, e.g., gene expression studies. However, these variable importance measures show a bias towards correlated predictor variables. Results: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. Conclusion: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: The brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is commonly used to screen for depression with 10 often recommended as the cut-off score. We summarized the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 across a range of studies and cut-off scores to select the optimal cut-off for detecting depression. Methods: We searched Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO from 1999 to August 2010 for studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of PHQ-9 to diagnose major depressive disorders. We calculated summary sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios for detecting major depressive disorder at different cut-off scores and in different settings. We used random-effects bivariate meta-analysis at cut-off points between 7 and 15 to produce summary receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: We identified 18 validation studies (n = 7180) conducted in various clinical settings. Eleven studies provided details about the diagnostic properties of the questionnaire at more than one cut-off score (including 10), four studies reported a cut-off score of 10, and three studies reported cut-off scores other than 10. The pooled specificity results ranged from 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.82) for a cut-off score of 7 to 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97) for a cut-off score of 15. There was major variability in sensitivity for cut-off scores between 7 and 15. There were no substantial differences in the pooled sensitivity and specificity for a range of cut-off scores (8-11). Interpretation: The PHQ-9 was found to have acceptable diagnostic properties for detecting major depressive disorder for cut-off scores between 8 and 11. Authors of future validation studies should consistently report the outcomes for different cut-off scores. {\textcopyright} 2012 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.},

abstract = {The pituitary gonadotrophins and testosterone are the main hormonal regulators of spermatogenesis, but estradiol is also known to play a role in the process. The hormonal responses in the testis are partially mediated by somatic Sertoli cells that provide nutritional and physical support for differentiating male germ cells. Hydroxysteroid (17b) dehydrogenase 1 (HSD17B1) is a steroidogenic enzyme that especially catalyzes the conversion of low potent 17keto-steroids to highly potent 17$\beta$-hydroxysteroids. In this study,we showthat Hsd17b1 is highly expressedinSertoli cells of fetal and newborn mice, and HSD17B1 knockout males present with disrupted spermatogenesis with major defects, particularly in the head shape of elongating spermatids. The cell-cell junctions between Sertoli cells and germ cells were disrupted in the HSD17B1 knockout mice. This resulted in complications in the orientation of elongating spermatids in the seminiferous epithelium, reduced sperm production, and morphologically abnormal spermatozoa. We also showed that the Sertoli cell-expressed HSD17B1 participates in testicular steroid synthesis, evidenced by a compensatory up-regulation ofHSD17B3 inLeydig cells.These results revealed a novel role forHSD17B1inthe control of spermatogenesis and male fertility, and that Sertoli cells significantly contribute to steroid synthesis in the testis.},

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a syndrome which serves as a classic example of psychiatric disorders that result from the intersection of nature and nurture, or gene and environment. By definition, PTSD requires the experience of a traumatic exposure, and yet data suggest that the risk for PTSD in the aftermath of trauma also has a heritable (genetic) component. Thus, PTSD appears to require both a biological (genetic) predisposition that differentially alters how the individual responds to or recovers from trauma exposure. Epigenetics is defined as the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself, and more recently it has come to refer to direct alteration of DNA regulation, but without altering the primary sequence of DNA, or the genetic code. With regards to PTSD, epigenetics provides one way for environmental exposure to be “written” upon the genome, as a direct result of gene and environment (trauma) interactions. This review provides an overview of the main currently understood types of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, histone regulation of chromatin, and noncoding RNA regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, we examine recent literature related to how these methods of epigenetic regulation may be involved in differential risk and resilience for PTSD in the aftermath of trauma.},

The mixed findings may in part result from sampling participants exposed to different trauma types at different times. Here, we controlled for this issue by sampling participants exposed to the same devastating hurricane. A total of 1.5 months after Hurricane Florence (T1), we asked 174 adults living in two severely affected states to describe their hurricane experience and fill in measures of PTSD and event centrality. Then, 7 months after the hurricane (T2), participants were reinvited to the survey, and 98 filled in the same questionnaire. The hurricane descriptions were coded for level of exposure severity. When controlling for trauma characteristics, including level of severity, younger age significantly predicted PTSD at T1 but not T2. When also controlling for event centrality, younger age predicted PTSD at both measurement times. Moreover, from T1 to T2, young adults significantly increased how severely they described their hurricane experience to be, whereas such amplification was absent in the older age groups. Overall, the findings provide some evidence that younger age increase vulnerability for PTSD and increase the perception of trauma severity over time},

abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in a substantial minority of emergency room admits. Inexpensive and accurate person-level assessment of PTSD risk after trauma exposure is a critical precursor to large-scale deployment of early interventions that may reduce individual suffering and societal costs. Toward this aim, we applied ensemble machine learning to predict PTSD screening status three months after severe injury using cost-effective and minimally invasive data. Participants (N = 271) were recruited at a Level 1 Trauma Center where they provided variables routinely collected at the hospital, including pulse, injury severity, and demographics, as well as psychological variables, including self-reported current depression, psychiatric history, and social support. Participant zip codes were used to extract contextual variables including population total and density, average annual income, and health insurance coverage rates from publicly available U.S. Census data. Machine learning yielded good prediction of PTSD screening status 3 months post-hospitalization, AUC = 0.85 95% CI [0.83, 0.86], and significantly outperformed all benchmark comparison models in a cross-validation procedure designed to yield an unbiased estimate of performance. These results demonstrate that good prediction can be attained from variables that individually have relatively weak predictive value, pointing to the promise of ensemble machine learning approaches that do not rely on strong isolated risk factors.},

abstract = {Data clustering describes a set of frequently employed techniques in exploratory data analysis to extract "natural" group structure in data. Such groupings need to be validated to separate the signal in the data from spurious structure. In this context, finding an appropriate number of clusters is a particularly important model selection question. We introduce a measure of cluster stability to assess the validity of a cluster model. This stability measure quantifies the reproducibility of clustering solutions on a second sample, and it can be interpreted as a classification risk with regard to class labels produced by a clustering algorithm. The preferred number of clusters is determined by minimizing this classification risk as a function of the number of clusters. Convincing results are achieved on simulated as well as gene expression data sets. Comparisons to other methods demonstrate the competitive performance of our method and its suitability as a general validation tool for clustering solutions in real-world problems.},

The disorder's identifiable onset and early symptoms provide opportunities for early detection and prevention. Empirical findings and theoretical models have outlined specific risk factors and pathogenic processes leading to PTSD. Controlled studies have shown that theory-driven preventive interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or stress hormone-targeted pharmacological interventions, are efficacious in selected samples of survivors. However, the effectiveness of early clinical interventions remains unknown, and results obtained in aggregates (large groups) overlook individual heterogeneity in PTSD pathogenesis. We review current evidence of PTSD prevention and outline the need to improve the disorder's early detection and intervention in individual-specific paths to chronic PTSD.},

abstract = {Objective To analyse the circumstances of fatal and non-fatal mountain hiking accidents caused by falls. Methods The study was designed as a retrospective analysis. Mountain hiking accidents caused by falls were documented during a 9-year period (2006-2014). After screening of all data for potential exclusion criteria the final sample size of 5368 accidents and 5665 victims was included into the analyses. Main outcome measures were details about accidents, victims, type of trail and surface. Results The annual number of accidents showed a continuous increase from 467 in 2006 to 700 in 2014. In total, 5.8% of all victims died during the 9-year period. 75.3% of the hikers fell during descent and 80.9% of the victims had their accident on a marked hiking trail or small path. The sex ratio for non-fatal accidents was 55% female and 45% male; for fatal accidents the female-to-male ratio was 28%:72%. Mean age of all victims was 52.5±17.5 years and victims of fatalities were about 5 years older compared with victims of non-fatal accidents (57.5±16.5 vs 52.2±17.5 years, P<0.01). Conclusion Descent is the most risky part for accidents caused by falls during mountain hiking. Male hikers are at greater risk for fatalities independent of age and this is associated with accidents occurring in pathless terrain. The death rate from falls was 6%. We recommend a critical self-assessment of the individual capabilities and mountain hiking skills and adequate planning of the hiking tours for mountain hikers.},

abstract = {Objective:To determine the prevalence of positive screening for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) amongst trauma patients. Design(s):Prospective, longitudinal study. Setting(s):Single urban US level 1 trauma center.Patients and methods:Four hundred fifty-two adult trauma patients were administered the PTSD checklist for DSM-V (PCL-5) survey upon posthospital outpatient clinic visit. This included 300 men (66%) and 152 women with mean age 43.8 years and mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) 11.3, with 83% having fractures of the pelvis and/or extremities. Medical and injury related variables were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of screening positive for PTSD.Main outcome measurement:Prevalence and risk factors for screening positive for PTSD amongst the trauma patient population. Result(s):Twenty-six percent of trauma patients screened positive for PTSD after mean 86 days following injury. These patients were younger (35 vs 46 years old, P < 0.001) and more commonly African American (56% vs 43% Caucasian, P < 0.001). Pedestrians struck by motor vehicles (OR 4.70, P = 0.040) and victims of crime (OR 4.12, P = 0.013) were more likely to screen positive. Psychiatric history, injury severity (ISS), and injury type did not predict positive screening. Conclusion(s):One-in-four patients suffering traumatic injuries screened positive for PTSD suggesting the prevalence of PTSD among trauma patients far exceeds that of the general population. Predictive factors included victims of crime and pedestrians struck by motor vehicles. Screening measures are needed in orthopaedic trauma surgery clinics to refer these at-risk patients for proper evaluation and treatment.

abstract = {Context: Traumatic events are common and are related to psychiatric impairment in childhood. Little is known about the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across different types of trauma exposure in children. Objective: To examine the developmental epidemiology of potential trauma and posttraumatic stress (PTS) in a longitudinal community sample of children. Methods: A representative population sample of 1420 children aged 9, 11, and 13 years at intake were followed up annually through 16 years of age. Main Outcome Measure: Traumatic events and PTS were assessed from child and parent reports annually to 16 years of age. Risk factors and DSM-IV disorders were also assessed. Results: More than two thirds of children reported at least 1 traumatic event by 16 years of age, with 13.4% of those children developing some PTS symptoms. Few PTS symptoms or psychiatric disorders were observed for individuals experiencing their first event, and any effects were short-lived. Less than 0.5% of children met the criteria for full-blown DSM-IV PTSD. Violent or sexual trauma were associated with the highest rates of symptoms. The PTS symptoms were predicted by previous exposure to multiple traumas, anxiety disorders, and family adversity. Lifetime co-occurrence of other psychiatric disorders with traumatic events and PTS symptoms was high, with the highest rates for anxiety and depressive disorders. Conclusions: In the general population of children, potentially traumatic events are fairly common and do not often result in PTS symptoms, except after multiple traumas or a history of anxiety. The prognosis after the first lifetime trauma exposure was generally favorable. Apart from PTSD, traumatic events are related to many forms of psychopathology, with the strongest links being with anxiety and depressive disorders. {\textcopyright}2007 American Medical Association.

This study aimed to estimate the magnitude of PTSD rate in mountain workers once we used a cover story to reduce sample bias. Mountain workers underwent either clinical interviews by means of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (n=60) or they self-reported their symptoms by means of an appropriate questionnaire of the PTSD Check List (PCL) (n=73). We also estimated the magnitude of PTSD rate by the means of meta-analysis. A discrepancy in the PTSD rate was observed as a function of the method used for the diagnosis [i.e., the interview method (22%) or the self-report method (5%)]. Furthermore, the meta-analysis shows that the overall estimation of PTSD varies and lies between 2.79% and 5.93% among this specific population with multiple exposures (range from 64% to 96% for exposure at least one TE). Our results are congruent with higher PTSD rates observed with other at-risk professionals. The present study reveals that mountains workers are frequently exposed to TE and according to the method of diagnosis the prevalence rate may present huge variations. This major finding points out the necessity to pay attention to the method used when the PTSD prevalence is estimated in the case of multiple exposure and among occupational population.},

abstract = {Background: For professional athletes, sports injury has been considered one of the most influential factors determining their athletic careers' duration and quality. High-intensity training and competitiveness of the sports competition are perhaps critical causes of sports-related stress. This article reviews the relevant research on sports injuries and stressor-related disorders. Further, it explores the following three issues in depth: (1) Do physical injuries caused by competitive sports lead to acute or posttraumatic stress disorder for athletes? What are the abnormal stress responses? (2) What diagnoses are currently available for sports injury related traumatic stress disorder? (3) What kinds of psychological rehabilitation are available for trauma-related symptoms in sports injury? How efficient are they in alleviating these symptoms? Methods: The study searched electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, etc. And reference lists of included papers were also screened. Two researchers selected the literature strictly according to the inclusion criteria and sorted them out. Based on the proved conclusions, the study established a new framework to manage traumatic stress disorders after the injury occurred. Results: 16 articles were included in the study. (Q1: N = 10; Q2: N = 3; Q3: N = 3) The findings of this review suggested that athletes who suffer from sports injuries are more likely to experience abnormal physiological or psychological stress responses, which may become a massive challenge for athletes to continue their sports careers at a competitive level. However, there is a minimal understanding of addressing sports injury-related traumatic stress disorder from a biological perspective. Thus, it is challenging to build a scientific basis for diagnosis, screening, and treatment. In addition, the current diagnostic tool for athletes stress disorder still heavily relies on subjective measurement, and the treatment plan is not different from that of the general population. Conclusions: It highlighted that sports-related stress disorder could be the greatest challenge to return to competition for injured athletes. The present study indicated the importance of systematically identifying the symptoms of sports-related stress disorder and improving the current diagnosis and treatment system.},

abstract = {Certain neighborhood factors may increase the risk of exposure to trauma, therefore increasing the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Other aspects of neighborhoods can be protective, such as neighborhood-based social relationships, which provide social support that buffers the risk of developing PTSD. The strength of these social relationships may not be as dependent on neighborhood conditions as much as they are contingent on socioeconomic similarities between neighborhood residents. Using a nationally representative sample of hospital emergency department admissions in the United States (N = 13,669,251), this study hypothesized that an interaction between family-level income and neighborhood-level income would be associated with adolescent PTSD. The results show that female adolescents who resided in the highest income areas were 1.39 times more likely, 95% CI [1.09, 1.77], to be diagnosed with PTSD than those who lived in the lowest income areas. This association was not statistically significant for male adolescents. Additionally, low-income female youth were nearly one-third more likely than their non–low-income counterparts to be diagnosed, odds ratio (OR) = 1.29, 95% CI [1.12, 1.48], whereas low-income male youth were nearly twice as likely than their non–low-income counterparts to be diagnosed, OR = 1.95, 95% CI [1.62, 2.34]. Furthermore, there was an interaction among both male and female adolescents such that lower-income adolescents living in higher-income areas had higher odds of a PTSD diagnosis compared to their higher-income peers in areas that were in the same median household income quartile.},

abstract = {Although women are exposed to proportionately fewer traumatic events in their lifetime than men, they have a higher lifetime risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition to gender-differential rates of rape and sexual assault, including greater exposure to intimate partner violence, the preponderance of PTSD in women may be attributable to factors other than trauma type, such as sensitisation of stress hormone systems in response to early adverse experiences, inherent neuroendocrine factors, subjective interpretation of the event, and peritraumatic dissociation. Women with PTSD arguably experience a greater symptom burden, longer course of illness and have worse quality-of-life outcomes than men. An expanding knowledge base of the psychobiological alterations in PTSD is providing stimulus for the development of improved pharmacological and psychosocial treatment options. Recent randomised controlled studies conducted in large samples of women with chronic PTSD indicate that: (i) SSRIs have efficacy on all three symptom clusters of PTSD and should be used as first-line pharmacotherapy; and (ii) cognitive behavioural strategies (e.g. prolonged exposure treatment and cognitive processing) are effective in sexually and non-sexually assaulted women. Studies also suggest that female gender may be associated with better response rates to pharmacotherapy. Emerging empirical data on the potential usefulness of antiadrenergic agents and preventive cognitive behavioural treatments in managing acute trauma reactions and stemming the emergence of PTSD are paving the way for further work in this area. However, additional innovative treatments are needed for traumatised women and for female children/adolescents presenting with acute stress reactions and PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

abstract = {In this study 60 backcountry and off-piste skiers as well as mountaineers, who survived an avalanche accident in the period from 1952 to 1999, were questioned about safety equipment, self rescue techniques during the descent of the avalanche and about post-traumatic stress disorders, using a standardised questionnaire. The percentage of persons, who were equipped with an electronic transceiver for the detection of totally buried victims increased significantly from 29% to 74% from the time periods 1970-1979 to 1990-1999 (p = 0.039), of persons equipped with an avalanche shovel from 14% to 77% (p = 0.006). No significant increase of the equipment with a probe (p = 0.53). None of the questioned persons was equipped with an avalanche air bag. During the descent of the avalanche, 18% of the skiers freed themselves from the skiers, 8% from skiers and ski-poles; 45% tried swimming to keep themselves on the surface of the snow masses. 50% of totally buried persons were able to protect their faces with the hands; all of them had free airways and an air pocket in front of mouth and nose when the avalanche was standing. 28% of all questioned persons had acute post-traumatic stress symptoms after the accident, 18% of the totally buried persons are still today suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorders. As a consequence of this study, we suggest an improvement in safety equipment of off-piste skiers and snowboarders by instructing all skiers in safety rules and self rescue techniques. The self-creation of an air pocket during the descent of the avalanche has absolute priority. For the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders of avalanche survivors and their relatives establishment of crisis intervention teams is recommended.},

abstract = {Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids. In Euclidean geometry the mean—as used in k-means—is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second (“SWAP”) phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (while retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now explore faster intialization strategies. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications.},

abstract = {Context: Little is known about lifetime prevalence or age of onset of DSM-IV disorders. Objective: To estimate lifetime prevalence and age-ofonset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication. Design and Setting: Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 using the fully structured World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Participants: Nine thousand two hundred eighty-two English-speaking respondents aged 18 years and older. Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse-control, and substance use disorders. Results: Lifetime prevalence estimates are as follows: anxiety disorders, 28.8%; mood disorders, 20.8%; impulse-control disorders, 24.8%; substance use disorders, 14.6%; any disorder, 46.4%. Median age of onset is much earlier for anxiety (11 years) and impulse-control (11 years) disorders than for substance use (20 years) and mood (30 years) disorders. Half of all lifetime cases start by age 14 years and three fourths by age 24 years. Later onsets are mostly of comorbid conditions, with estimated lifetime risk of any disorder at age 75 years (50.8%) only slightly higher than observed lifetime prevalence (46.4%). Lifetime prevalence estimates are higher in recent cohorts than in earlier cohorts and have fairly stable intercohort differences across the life course that vary in substantively plausible ways among sociodemographic subgroups. Conclusions: About half of Americans will meet the criteria for a DSM-IV disorder sometime in their life, with first onset usually in childhood or adolescence.

Previous studies have retrospectively examined the relationship of preinjury psychiatric status and postinjury PTSD with conflicting results, but no prospective studies regarding this subject have been conducted, to our knowledge. Objective: To prospectively assess the relationship of predeployment psychiatric status and injury severity with postdeployment PTSD. Design: Prospective, longitudinal study. Setting: United States military personnel deployed in support of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Participants: United States service member participants in the Millennium Cohort Study who completed a baseline questionnaire (from July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2003) and at least 1 follow-up questionnaire (from June 1, 2004, through February 14, 2006, and from May 15, 2007, through December 31, 2008) and who were deployed in the intervening period. Self-reported health information was used to prospectively examine the relationship between baseline psychiatric status and follow-up PTSD in injured and uninjured deployed individuals. Main Outcome Measures: A positive screening result using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version. Results: Of 22 630 eligible participants, 1840 (8.1%) screened positive for PTSD at follow-up, and 183 (0.8%) sustained a deployment-related physical injury that was documented in the Joint Theater Trauma Registry or the Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database. The odds of screening positive for PTSD symptoms were 2.52 (95% confidence interval, 2.01-3.16) times greater in those with 1 or more defined baseline mental health disorder and 16.1% (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.34) greater for every 3-unit increase in the Injury Severity Score. Irrespective of injury severity, self-reported preinjury psychiatric status was significantly associated with PTSD at follow-up. Conclusions: Baseline psychiatric status and deploymentrelated physical injuries were associated with screening positive for postdeployment PTSD. More vulnerable members of the deployed population might be identified and benefit from interventions targeted to prevent or to ensure early identification and treatment of postdeployment PTSD. {\textcopyright}2011 American Medical Association.

@article{Bryant2019,
abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM-III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up-to-date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence-supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best-validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two-thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence-based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.},

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a global health issue, with prevalence rates ranging from 1.3% to 37.4%. As there is little current data on PTSD in Canada, an epidemiological study was conducted examining PTSD and related comorbid conditions. Modified versions of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) PTSD module, the depression, alcohol and substance abuse sections of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), as well as portions of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were combined, and administered via telephone interview in English or French. Random digit dialing was used to obtain a nationally representative sample of 2991, aged 18 years and above from across Canada. The prevalence rate of lifetime PTSD in Canada was estimated to be 9.2%, with a rate of current (1-month) PTSD of 2.4%. Traumatic exposure to at least one event sufficient to cause PTSD was reported by 76.1% of respondents. The most common forms of trauma resulting in PTSD included unexpected death of a loved one, sexual assault, and seeing someone badly injured or killed. In respondents meeting criteria for PTSD, the symptoms were chronic in nature, and associated with significant impairment and high rates of comorbidity. PTSD is a common psychiatric disorder in Canada. The results are surprising, given the comparably low rates of violent crime, a small military and few natural disasters. Potential implications of these findings are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {In the past few decades clinical science has emerged as a prominent model for training and practice in clinical psychology. This model emphasizes evidence derived from high-quality research and is consistent with the increasingly influential evidence-based movement in medicine, which is a vital step toward making psychotherapy more effective, efficient, and safe. Despite this trend, much current psychological practice is not evidence-based; moreover, there is a marked dearth of resources available to train students and assist practitioners with the challenging goal of translating science into practice. Case Studies in Clinical Psychological Science demonstrates in detail how the clinical science model can be applied to actual cases. Edited by Professors William O'Donohue and Scott O. Lilienfeld, this book's unique structure presents dialogues between leading clinical researchers regarding the treatment of a wide variety of psychological problems, from depression and Alzheimer's disease to Panic Disorder and chronic pain. Chapters describe what evidence-based practice consists of for various clinical problems and are followed by commentary sections in which other leading clinical researchers analyze the case at hand, pointing out additional assessment and treatment options and controversial issues. The chapter authors then reply to the commentary in response sections. By examining the application of scientifically based interventions to actual cases and modeling thoughtful and collegial discussion among prominent clinical researchers, Case Studies in Clinical Psychological Science will assist students, practitioners, and clinical researchers with the crucial task of applying research evidence to psychotherapy and bridging the gap between science and practice.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of injury site and severity as predictors of mental health outcomes in the initial 12 months following traumatic injury. Using a multisite, longitudinal study, participants with a traumatic physical injury (N = 1,098) were assessed during hospital admission and followed up at 3 months (N = 932, 86%) and at 12 months (N = 715, 71%). Injury site was measured using the Abbreviated Injury Scale 90, and objective injury severity was measured using the Injury Severity Score. Participants also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Clinician Administered Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale. A random intercept mixed modelling analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of site and severity of injury in relation to anxiety, PTSD, and depressive symptoms. Injury severity, as well as head and facial injuries, was predictive of elevated PTSD symptoms, and external injuries were associated with both PTSD and depression severity. In contrast, lower extremity injuries were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. The findings suggest that visible injuries are predictive of reduced mental health, particularly PTSD following traumatic injury. This has clinical implications for further advancing the screening for vulnerable injured trauma survivors at risk of chronic psychopathology.},

abstract = {The main drawback of principal component analysis (PCA) especially for applications in high dimensions is that the extracted components are linear combinations of all input variables. To facilitate the interpretability of PCA various sparse methods have been proposed recently. However all these methods might suffer from the influence of outliers present in the data. An algorithm to compute sparse and robust PCA was recently proposed by Croux et al. We compare this method to standard (non-sparse) classical and robust PCA and several other sparse methods. The considered methods are illustrated on a real data example and compared in a simulation experiment. It is shown that the robust sparse method preserves the sparsity and at the same time provides protection against contamination. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Introduction: Affective responses during physical activity (PA) are important for engagement in PA programs and for adherence to a physically active lifestyle. Little is known about the affective responses to PA bouts lasting longer than 45 minutes. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to analyse acute effects on affective responses of a three-hour outdoor PA intervention (mountain hiking) compared to a sedentary control situation and to an indoor treadmill condition. Methods: Using a randomized crossover design, 42 healthy participants were randomly exposed to three different conditions: outdoor mountain hiking, indoor treadmill walking, and sedentary control situation (approximately three hours each). Measures included the Feeling Scale, Felt Arousal Scale and a Mood Survey Scale. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to analyse differences between the conditions. Results: Compared to the control situation, the participants showed a significant increase in affective valence (d = 1.21, p < .001), activation (d = 0.81, p = .004), elation (d = 1.07, p < .001), and calmness (d = 0.84, p = .004), and a significant decrease in fatigue (d = -1.19, p < .001) and anxiety (d = -.79, p < .001) after mountain hiking. Outdoor mountain hiking showed significantly greater positive effects on affective valence, activation, and fatigue compared to indoor treadmill walking. Discussion: The results indicate that a three-hour PA intervention (mountain hiking) elicits higher positive and lower negative affective responses compared to a sedentary control situation and to an indoor PA condition. Outdoor mountain hiking can be recommended by health professionals as a form of PA with the potential to positively influence affective responses.

@article{Burri2014,
abstract = {Background: Guided by previous explorations of historical and cultural influences on the occurrence of PTSD, the aim of the present study was to investigate the contributions of war victimisation (in particular, World War II) and other civil trauma on the prevalence of PTSD, as mediated by cultural value orientation. Secondary data analysis was performed for 12 European countries using data, including PTSD prevalence and number of war victims, crime victims, and natural disaster victims, from different sources. Ten single value orientations, as well as value aggregates for traditional and modern factors, were investigated. Results: Whilst differences in PTSD prevalence were strongly associated with war victim rates, associations, albeit weaker, were also found between crime victims and PTSD. When cultural value orientations, such as stimulation and conformity as representatives of modern and traditional values, were included in the multivariate predictions of PTSD prevalence, an average of approximately 80% of PTSD variance could be explained by the model, independent of the type of trauma exposure. Conclusion: The results suggest that the aftermath of war contributes to current PTSD prevalence, which may be explained by the high proportion of the older population who directly or indirectly experienced traumatic war experiences. Additional findings for other types of civil trauma point towards an interaction between value orientation and country-specific trauma rates. Particularly, being personally oriented towards stimulation appears to interact with differences in trauma prevalence. Thus, cultural value orientation might be viewed not only as an individual intrinsic process but also as a compensatory strategy after trauma exposure. {\textcopyright} 2014 Burri and Maercker; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Importance: A substantial proportion of the 40 million people in the US who present to emergency departments (EDs) each year after traumatic events develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or major depressive episode (MDE). Accurately identifying patients at high risk in the ED would facilitate the targeting of preventive interventions. Objectives: To develop and validate a prediction tool based on ED reports after a motor vehicle collision to predict PTSD or MDE 3 months later. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Advancing Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study is a longitudinal study that examined adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequalae among patients who presented to 28 US urban EDs in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic experience. Enrollment began on September 25, 2017. The 1003 patients considered in this diagnostic/prognostic report completed 3-month assessments by January 31, 2020. Each patient received a baseline ED assessment along with follow-up self-report surveys 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months later. An ensemble machine learning method was used to predict 3-month PTSD or MDE from baseline information. Data analysis was performed from November 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was used to assess PTSD and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression Short-Form 8b to assess MDE. Results: A total of 1003 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 34.5 [24-43] years; 715 [weighted 67.9%] female; 100 [weighted 10.7%] Hispanic, 537 [weighted 52.7%] non-Hispanic Black, 324 [weighted 32.2%] non-Hispanic White, and 42 [weighted 4.4%] of non-Hispanic other race or ethnicity were included in this study. A total of 274 patients (weighted 26.6%) met criteria for 3-month PTSD or MDE. An ensemble machine learning model restricted to 30 predictors estimated in a training sample (patients from the Northeast or Midwest) had good prediction accuracy (mean [SE] area under the curve [AUC], 0.815 [0.031]) and calibration (mean [SE] integrated calibration index, 0.040 [0.002]; mean [SE] expected calibration error, 0.039 [0.002]) in an independent test sample (patients from the South). Patients in the top 30% of predicted risk accounted for 65% of all 3-month PTSD or MDE, with a mean (SE) positive predictive value of 58.2% (6.4%) among these patients at high risk. The model had good consistency across regions of the country in terms of both AUC (mean [SE], 0.789 [0.025] using the Northeast as the test sample and 0.809 [0.023] using the Midwest as the test sample) and calibration (mean [SE] integrated calibration index, 0.048 [0.003] using the Northeast as the test sample and 0.024 [0.001] using the Midwest as the test sample; mean [SE] expected calibration error, 0.034 [0.003] using the Northeast as the test sample and 0.025 [0.001] using the Midwest as the test sample). The most important predictors in terms of Shapley Additive Explanations values were symptoms of anxiety sensitivity and depressive disposition, psychological distress in the 30 days before motor vehicle collision, and peritraumatic psychosomatic symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that a short set of questions feasible to administer in an ED can predict 3-month PTSD or MDE with good AUC, calibration, and geographic consistency. Patients at high risk can be identified in the ED for targeting if cost-effective preventive interventions are developed.},

About 75% of all falls hap-pened during the descent and 70% of the victims who sustained a fall-related injury showed defective vision. Mountain hikers should pay attention to sufficient regeneration before and breaks during descending. Additionally, a regular check of visual aids (glasses, contact lenses) can be recommended. › In recreational alpine skiing, the injury rate is estimated to be less than 1 injury per 1000 skier days and the traumatic fatality rate amounts to 0.36 traumatic deaths per million skier days. A tear of the anterior cruciate ligament is the most com-mon diagnosis with about 15-21% of all injuries and the risk is 3 times higher in women than in men. Protective equipment and an appropriate skiing speed, depending on skill level, represent preventive measures to reduce injuries and traumatic deaths.},

abstract = {Background: As any traumatic event, avalanches could trigger psychological disorders on survivors. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among avalanche survivors and to evaluate post-traumatic stress disorder risks factors as well as the impact on quality of life. Methods: A multicentre study was conducted in victims included in the North Alpine Avalanche Registry from 2014 to 2018. Data were collected through a standard questionnaire during semi-directed phone interviews. The primary outcome was the total score on the Impact of Event Scale Revised. Secondary outcomes were the Mental Component Scale and the Physical Component Scale scores of the Short Form 12 questionnaire. Results: During the study period, 132 of 211 victims survived. Among the 107 victims included, 55 (51.4%) phone interviews were obtained. Six patients (10.9, 95% CI 1.76–20.05) had an Impact of Event Scale Revised score ≥ 33 indicating a strong probability for post-traumatic stress disorder. Median Mental Component Scale score was 39.0 (IQR 30.5–46.3) for post-traumatic stress disorder patients and 40.1 (IQR 36.5–43.4) for non post-traumatic stress disorder (p = 0.76). Median Physical Component Scale score was 39.4 (37.2–44.3) for post-traumatic stress disorder patients and 44.2 (39.1–46.8) for non post-traumatic stress disorder (p = 0.39). No significant difference in the quality of life in both populations was observed, and no independent risk factors of post-traumatic stress disorder was identified. Conclusion: Avalanche accidents may induce post-traumatic stress disorders among survivors in a comparable prevalence to the most traumatic event already studied. Early recognition and preventive measures should be set up in order to reduce the psychological burden in these victims. Trial registration: NCT03936738.},

MEDLINE searches were performed and supplemented by consultations with experts across Europe to identify non-published reports. Despite variations in the design of studies, available data suggest that (a) about 2% of the adult population in the community is affected (12-month prevalence), (b) GAD is one of the most frequent (up to 10%) of all mental disorders seen in primary care, (c) GAD is a highly impairing condition often comorbid with other mental disorders, (d) GAD patients are high utilizers of healthcare resources, and (e) despite the high prevalence of GAD in primary care, its recognition in general practice is relatively low. Marked data deficits are: lack of data from eastern European countries, lack of information about the natural course of GAD in unselected samples, the vulnerability and risk factors involved in the aetiology of GAD and lack of data about adequate and inappropriate treatments in GAD patients as well as the associated and societal costs of GAD. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

abstract = {In feminising testicular tumours, oestrogens can be either secreted by the tumour itself or produced by normal Leydig cells in response to paracrine and/ or endocrine stimulation by hCG. Typical hormonal Leydig cell turnout patterns include: plasma oestradiol levels > 300 pmol/l on day 3 following an hCG injection, reduced plasma testosterone, and normal plasma hCG and gonadotrophin levels. Except for elevated plasma oestradiol levels, opposite results are observed in seminomas. We report a case of oestrogen-secreting seminoma mimicking a Leydig cell tumour. A 24-year-old Caucasian patient had complained of gynaecomastia for 6 months before admission. Hormonal pattern was typical of Leydig cell tumour. A 1.4 cm tumour was found in the left testis and confirmed on sonography. Considering the likely diagnosis of Leydig cell tumour, the patient was treated by tumourectomy. Surprisingly, pathological examination revealed a pure seminoma. Perifusion experiments showed that the tumour was able to secrete significant amounts of oestradiol. In addition, hCG induced a two-fold increase in oestradiol production from perifused tumour explants. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumour was composed of nests of seminoma cells intermingled with lymphoid infiltrates. Tumour cells also expressed aromatase, the hCG/LH receptor and the Leydig cell marker relaxin-like factor, but were $\beta$hCG-negative. These results demonstrate that a pure seminoma of the testis is able to synthesise and secrete oestrogens. They also illustrate that the body of proof favouring the diagnosis of feminising Leydig cell tumour of the testis is not rigorously specific.},

abstract = {There is broad interest in predicting the clinical course of mental disorders from early, multimodal clinical and biological information. Current computational models, however, constitute a significant barrier to realizing this goal. The early identification of trauma survivors at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is plausible given the disorder's salient onset and the abundance of putative biological and clinical risk indicators. This work evaluates the ability of Machine Learning (ML) forecasting approaches to identify and integrate a panel of unique predictive characteristics and determine their accuracy in forecasting non-remitting PTSD from information collected within10 days of a traumatic event. Data on event characteristics, emergency department observations, and early symptoms were collected in 957 trauma survivors, followed for fifteen months. An ML feature selection algorithm identified a set of predictors that rendered all others redundant. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as other ML classification algorithms were used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of i) ML selected features, ii) all available features without selection, and iii) Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) symptoms alone. SVM also compared the prediction of a) PTSD diagnostic status at 15 months to b) posterior probability of membership in an empirically derived non-remitting PTSD symptom trajectory. Results are expressed as mean Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). The feature selection algorithm identified 16 predictors, present in ≥95% cross-validation trials. The accuracy of predicting non-remitting PTSD from that set (AUC=77) did not differ from predicting from all available information (AUC=78). Predicting from ASD symptoms was not better then chance (AUC=60). The prediction of PTSD status was less accurate than that of membership in a non-remitting trajectory (AUC=71). ML methods may fill a critical gap in forecasting PTSD. The ability to identify and integrate unique risk indicators makes this a promising approach for developing algorithms that infer probabilistic risk of chronic posttraumatic stress psychopathology based on complex sources of biological, psychological, and social information.},

abstract = {Introduction: The impact of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the associated governmental restrictions on mental health have been reported in different countries. This cross-sectional study evaluated mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria and the association with sociodemographic factors (i.e., age, sex, education, income, employment status, partnership status, and migration background). Methods: A representative sample (N = 1,031) of the Austrian general population was surveyed online end of April 2022. Indicators of mental health were depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), insomnia (ISI), alcohol abuse (CAGE), eating disorders (SCOFF), and stress (PSS-10). Results: 1,031 participants completed the online survey (50.3% women; mean age: 45.6 ± 17.23 years). Cut-offs for clinically relevant depression were exceeded by 28%. 16% scored above the cut-off for clinically relevant anxiety symptoms, 15% for clinical insomnia, 18% for alcohol abuse, 26% for eating disorders, and 65% for moderate to high stress. Comparisons with another cross-sectional representative Austrian sample recruited during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria (April 2020) revealed increases in depression (from 21 to 28%) but no significant changes in anxiety, insomnia, and moderate to high stress. Multivariable logistic regression showed the strongest associations of mental health indicators with age, income, and sex. Increasing age and income were associated with lower odds of mental health symptoms. Being female compared to male increased the odds of depressive symptoms while decreasing the odds of alcohol abuse. Discussion: The COVID-19 crisis seems particularly stressful for younger adults (<35 years) and people with low income (<€2,000 net household income per month). Policymakers need to consider the high social and economic costs of lockdowns and think of optimal intervention methods for mental disorders among young and low-income individuals.},

abstract = {Background: Traumatic exposure is a frequent issue in patients visiting emergency departments (EDs). Some patients will subsequently develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) while other will not. The problem is under-diagnosed in EDs and no standardized management is provided to prevent PTSD. Most studies focused on a particular group of trauma whereas we need a global approach to further develop interventions for detecting and treating patients at high risk. We aim to assess the prevalence of traumatic exposure and situation at high risk of further PTSD and identify pre and peri-traumatic biopsychosocial factors predisposing individuals to PTSD in the general context of EDs. Methods: This comprehensive multicenter study will have two steps. The first step will be a cross-sectional study on moderate and high risk of PTSD prevalence among EDs visitors with a recent history of trauma. All patients aged 18-70 years, presenting with a recent history of trauma (< 1 month) in one of the six EDs in the Auvergne-Rh{\^{o}}ne-Alpes region (≈1/10° of the French population) will be included over a 1-month period and approximately 1500 subjects are expected in this cross-sectional step. The risk of PTSD will be assessed using the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R). Self-administered questionnaires will be used to measure acute stress (IES-R), and a number of potential bio-psycho-social risk factors. Demographic and physical health-related data will be collected from medical file. Second step will be a prospective cohort study within a sub-sample of 400 patients enrolled in step 1, randomly selected with stratification on sex, age, ED, and IES-R score. At 3 months, PTSD will be defined by a ≥ 33 score at PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5) through a telephone interview. We will evaluate definite PTSD biopsychosocial predictive factors using a multivariate logistic regression model and describe evolution of PTSD at 3 months. Discussion: This is the first study to assess PTSD predictors prospectively with a biopsychosocial approach within a cohort representative of EDs visitors. The results will inform the development of dedicated interventions to decrease the risk of subsequent PTSD.

abstract = {Semi-supervised clustering which uses the limited labeled data to aid unsupervised clustering, has become a hot topic in recent years. But the limited labeled data may be imbalanced and can not cover all clusters in some cases and most of the existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms can not deal with imbalanced dataset well and have no the ability of detecting new clusters. In view of this, an adaptive semi-supervised clustering algorithm with label propagation is proposed. Two most of interesting characteristics of the proposed algorithm are that (1) It uses the limited labeled data to expand labeled dataset based on an adaptive threshold by labeling their k-nearest neighbors, (2) It detects whether there exist new clusters in the unlabeled dataset according to a proposed measure criterion. Three standard datasets are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results confirm that the accuracy of the proposed clustering algorithm is much higher than that of three compared algorithm and in addition the proposed algorithm has the ability of detecting new clusters. {\textcopyright} 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract = {Background Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity. Methods A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use. Results A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale. Conclusion The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.},

Thus, this meta-analysis aims to explore the relationship between PTG and PTSD symptoms through the Pearson correlation coefficient. A systematic search of the literature from January 1996 to November 2015 was completed. We retrieved reports on 63 studies that involved 26, 951 patients. The weighted correlation coefficient revealed an effect size of 0.22 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.18 to 0.25. Meta-analysis provides evidence that PTG may be positively correlated with PTSD symptoms and that this correlation may be modified by age, trauma type, and time since trauma. Accordingly, people with high levels of PTG should not be ignored, but rather, they should continue to receive help to alleviate their PTSD symptoms.},

One of the most appealing robust methods for principal component analysis uses the Projection-Pursuit principle. Here, one projects the data on a lower-dimensional space such that a robust measure of variance of the projected data will be maximized. The Projection-Pursuit-based method for principal component analysis has recently been introduced in the field of chemometrics, where the number of variables is typically large. In this paper, it is shown that the currently available algorithm for robust Projection-Pursuit PCA performs poor in the presence of many variables. A new algorithm is proposed that is more suitable for the analysis of chemical data. Its performance is studied by means of simulation experiments and illustrated on some real data sets. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective Although exposure to potentially traumatic experiences (PTEs) is common among youths in the United States, information on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk associated with PTEs is limited. We estimate lifetime prevalence of exposure to PTEs and PTSD, PTE-specific risk of PTSD, and associations of sociodemographics and temporally prior DSM-IV disorders with PTE exposure, PTSD given exposure, and PTSD recovery among U.S. adolescents. Method Data were drawn from 6,483 adolescent-parent pairs in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a national survey of adolescents aged 13 through 17 years. Lifetime exposure to interpersonal violence, accidents/injuries, network/witnessing, and other PTEs was assessed along with DSM-IV PTSD and other distress, fear, behavior, and substance disorders. Results A majority (61.8%) of adolescents experienced a lifetime PTE. Lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV PTSD was 4.7% and was significantly higher among females (7.3%) than among males (2.2%). Exposure to PTEs, particularly interpersonal violence, was highest among adolescents not living with both biological parents and with pre-existing behavior disorders. Conditional probability of PTSD was highest for PTEs involving interpersonal violence. Predictors of PTSD among PTE-exposed adolescents included female gender, prior PTE exposure, and pre-existing fear and distress disorders. One-third (33.0%) of adolescents with lifetime PTSD continued to meet criteria within 30 days of interview. Poverty, U.S. nativity, bipolar disorder, and PTE exposure occurring after the focal trauma predicted nonrecovery. Conclusions Interventions designed to prevent PTSD in PTE-exposed youths should be targeted at victims of interpersonal violence with pre-existing fear and distress disorders, whereas interventions designed to reduce PTSD chronicity should attempt to prevent secondary PTE exposure. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.},

Two samples of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (ns = 90 and 140) provide evidence for the reliability and validity of the BRCS. The BRCS has adequate internal consistency and test-re test reliability. Convergent validity of the scale is demonstrated by predictable correlations with measures of personal coping resources (e.g.,-optimism, helplessness, self-efficacy), pain coping behaviors, and psychological well-being. Resilient coping, as assessed by the BRCS, also buffers the effects of high levels of arthritis-related and non-arthritis-related stressors on depressive symptoms. The sensitivity of the BRCS to changes associated with a cognitive-behavioral intervention is also demonstrated. The BCRS may be useful for identifying individuals in need of interventions designed to enhance resilient coping skills. {\textcopyright} 2004 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {Objective: To examine the lifetime prevalence of trauma experiences and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: Questionnaire-assessed PTSD, the type of traumatic event experienced, perceived trauma impact, and trauma frequency in 1824 randomly selected men and women. Results: PTSD lifetime prevalence was estimated at 5.6% with a 1:2 male-to-female ratio, in spite of men reporting greater trauma exposure. The highest PTSD risk was associated with sexual and physical assault, robbery and multiple trauma experiences. Controlling for trauma type did not account for gender differences, while controlling for experienced distress did. Conclusion: The conditional probability for PTSD varied as a function of trauma type, frequency and impact of the event, with increased rates associated with prevalent trauma exposure and higher perceived distress. The latter accounted for the gender effect, suggesting that gender differences in PTSD in part represent a generally greater vulnerability to stress in women. {\textcopyright} Blackwell Munksgaard 2004.},

abstract = {Common knowledge implies that individuals engaging in outdoor sports and especially in regular and extreme mountaineering are exceptionally healthy and hardened. Physical activity in outdoor environments has a positive effect on physical and mental health. However, regular and/or extreme mountaineering might share similarities with behavioural addictions and could thus also have a negative impact on health. In this cross-sectional web-based questionnaire study, we collected data on exercise and mountaineering addiction (Exercise Addiction Inventory; original and adapted version for mountaineering; Exercise Dependence Scale adapted version for mountaineering). Further surveyed parameters included mountaineering habits, Risk-Taking Inventory, Sensation-Seeking/Emotion Regulation/Agency Scale (SEAS), resilience, self-perceived stress, physical activity in metabolic units and mental health. Comparisons were performed between individuals with symptoms of addiction to mountaineering (MA) and individuals without symptoms of addiction to mountaineering or sports in general (CO) using non-parametric analyses. We analysed data from 335 participants, n = 88 thereof with addiction to mountaineering (MA) and n = 247 control participants (CO). The MA group scored significantly higher with regards to self-perceived stress (p < 0.001) and included a significantly higher number of individuals affected by symptoms of depression (p < 0.001), symptoms of anxiety (p < 0.001), symptoms of eating disorders (p < 0.001), alcohol abuse or dependence (p < 0.001), illicit drug abuse (p = 0.050), or current and history of psychiatric disorders (p < 0.001). Individuals with MA showed higher values in all SEAS subscales as well as increased risk-taking (p < 0.001). Regular and extreme mountaineering can display features of a behavioural addiction and is associated with psychiatric disorders. Behavioural addiction in mountaineering is associated with higher levels of sensation-seeking, emotion regulation, and agency, as well as increased risk-taking.},

abstract = {Knowledge about potential protective factors against mental health problems is highly needed. Regular physical activity (PA) in an outdoor environment, like mountain exercising, might reduce psychological distress. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to assess the prevalence of mental health problems in mountain exercisers and to detect factors associated with psychological distress. In a cross-sectional design, we collected self-reported data of 1,536 Austrian mountain exercisers. The prevalence of mental health problems and psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale), the level of PA International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and affective valence during PA (Feeling Scale) were obtained. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to assess factors influencing psychological distress. The prevalence of mental health problems in Austrian mountain exercisers was 14%. Health-enhancing PA level and higher affective valence during PA were significantly associated with lower psychological distress. Minimal PA level was not significantly associated with lower psychological distress compared to inactive PA level. Marital status, education, alpine association membership, and body mass index did not show a significant influence on psychological distress. The prevalence of mental health problems seems to be lower in Austrian mountain exercisers compared to the European population. A health-enhancing PA level and affective valence increasing forms of PA were shown to be associated with lower psychological distress. Results might lead to interventional studies focusing on the potential of outdoor PA, e.g., mountain exercise, as an adjunct treatment in people at risk or with mental health problems.},

abstract = {Comparison is a fundamental method of scientific research leading to insights about the processes that generate similarity or dissimilarity. In statistical terms comparisons between probability functions are performed to infer connections, correlations, or relationships between objects or samples (Cha 2007). Most quantification methods rely on distance or similarity measures, but the right choice for each individual application is not always clear and sometimes poorly explored. The reason for this is partly that diverse measures are either implemented in different R packages with very different notations or are not implemented at all. Thus, a comprehensive framework implementing the most common similarity and distance measures using a uniform notation is still missing. The R (R Core Team 2018) package Philentropy aims to fill this gap by implementing forty-six fundamental distance and similarity measures (Cha 2007) for comparing probability functions. These comparisons between probability functions have their foundations in a broad range of scientific disciplines from mathematics to ecology. The aim of this package is to provide a comprehensive and computationally optimized base framework for clustering, classification, statistical inference, goodness-of-fit, non-parametric statistics, information theory, and machine learning tasks that are based on comparing univariate or multivari-ate probability functions. All functions are written in C++ and are integrated into the R package using the Rcpp Application Programming Interface (API) (Eddelbuettel 2013). Together, this framework allows building new similarity or distance based (statistical) models and algorithms in R which are computationally efficient and scalable. The comprehensive availability of diverse metrics and measures furthermore enables a systematic assessment of choosing the most optimal similarity or distance measure for individual applications in diverse scientific disciplines. The following probability distance/similarity and information theory measures are implemented in Philentropy.

abstract = {Purpose: We sought to estimate the pooled current prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among rescue workers and to determine the variables implicated in the heterogeneity observed among the prevalences of individual studies. Methods: A systematic review covering studies reporting on the PTSD prevalence in rescue teams was conducted following four sequential steps: (1) research in specialized online databases, (2) review of abstracts and selection of studies, (3) review of reference list, and (4) contact with authors and experts. Prevalence data from all studies were pooled using random effects model. Multivariate metaregression models were fitted to identify variables related to the prevalences heterogeneity. Results: A total of 28 studies, reporting on 40 samples with 20,424 rescuers, were selected. The worldwide pooled current prevalence was 10%. Meta-regression modeling in studies carried out in the Asian continent had, on average, higher estimated prevalences than those from Europe, but not higher than the North American estimates. Studies of ambulance personnel also showed higher estimated PTSD prevalence than studies with firefighters and police officers. Conclusions: Rescue workers in general have a pooled current prevalence of PTSD that is much higher than that of the general population. Ambulance personnel and rescuers from Asia may be more susceptible to PTSD. These results indicate the need for improving pre-employment strategies to select the most resilient individuals for rescue work, to implement continuous preventive measures for personnel, and to promote educational campaigns about PTSD and its therapeutic possibilities. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract = {Since the beginning of medical science, much research have focused on the psychopathological effects of traumatic experiences. Despite in past centuries the scientific literature on mental health has been mainly focused on the harmful effects of traumatic occurrences, more recently the idea of “post-traumatic growth” emerged, on the basis of a growing interest in the characteristics of resilience and possible positive consequences of trauma. In this framework, increasing attention is now being paid to the psychological meaning of PTG, with a consistent number of psychopathological and epidemiological studies on this subject, but limited literature focused on neurobiological correlates or eventual biomarkers of this condition. The present work aimed to summarize and review the available evidence on neurobiological correlates of PTG and their psychological and clinical meaning. Results highlighted a variety of biochemical and neurobiological differences between PTG and non-PTG individuals, partially corroborating findings from earlier research on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, although promising, findings in this field are still too limited and additional studies on the neurobiological correlates of traumatic experiences are needed in order to gain a better understanding of the subject.},

A subsample of these participants (n = 140) was used to define a valid diagnostic cutoff score for the instrument using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5; Weathers, Blake, et al., 2013) as the reference standard. The PCL-5 test scores demonstrated good internal consistency (a =. 96), test-retest reliability (r =. 84), and convergent and discriminant validity. Consistent with previous studies (Armour et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014), confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the data were best explained by a 6-factor anhedonia model and a 7-factor hybrid model. Signal detection analyses using the CAPS-5 revealed that PCL-5 scores of 31 to 33 were optimally efficient for diagnosing PTSD (k(.5) =. 58). Overall, the findings suggest that the PCL-5 is a psychometrically sound instrument that can be used effectively with veterans. Further, by determining a valid cutoff score using the CAPS-5, the PCL-5 can now be used to identify veterans with probable PTSD. However, findings also suggest the need for research to evaluate cluster structure of DSM-5.},

abstract = {Alpine sport is a popular form of exercise and provides several skills that are potentially relevant for positive development during adolescence. However, empirical data on differences between alpine and non-alpine sport participants in variables related to developmental changes are lacking. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to analyze differences in self-esteem and additional variables between adolescent alpine and non-alpine sport participants. A comparison to non-regular exercisers was conducted for self-esteem. In a cross-sectional design, information on self-esteem, sensation seeking, agency, and emotion regulation was collected in 183 adolescents [(mean age: 15.4 (SD: 2.3) years, 71.0% female)]. Alpine sport participants reported significantly higher self-esteem compared to non-regular exercisers, p = 0.003, d = 0.95, but not compared to non-alpine sport participants, p = 0.774, d = 0.06. When controlling for sex and high-risk sport engagement, alpine sport participants showed a significantly higher experience of agency compared to non-alpine sport participants, p = 0.016, d = 0.46. We conclude that alpine sport participation is less relevant with regard to self-esteem compared to regular exercise. However, the characteristics of alpine sport might provide a trigger for higher experience of agency during sport participation, potentially helping to satisfy the increased need for autonomy and independence in adolescence.},

abstract = {Background Violence and other traumatic events, as well as psychiatric disorders are frequent in developing countries, but there are few population studies to show the actual impact of traumatic events in the psychiatric morbidity in low and middle-income countries (LMIC).  Aims To study the relationship between traumatic events and prevalence of mental disorders in S{\~{a}}o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Methods Cross-sectional survey carried out in 2007–2008 with a probabilistic representative sample of 15- to 75-year-old residents in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.  Results The sample comprised 3744 interviews. Nearly 90% of participants faced lifetime traumatic events. Lifetime prevalence of any disorders was 44% in Sao Paulo and 42.1% in Rio de Janeiro. One-year estimates were 32.5% and 31.2%. One-year prevalence of traumatic events was higher in Rio de Janeiro than Sao Paulo (35.1 vs. 21.7; p<0.001). Participants from Rio de Janeiro were less likely to have alcohol dependence (OR = 0.55; p = 0.027), depression (OR = 0.6; p = 0.006) generalized anxiety (OR = 0.59; p = 0.021) and post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 0.62; p = 0.027). Traumatic events correlated with all diagnoses – e.g. assaultive violence with alcohol dependence (OR = 5.7; p<0.001) and with depression (OR = 1.7; p = 0.001).  Conclusion Our findings show that psychiatric disorders and traumatic events, especially violence, are extremely common in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, supporting the idea that neuropsychiatric disorders and external causes have become a major public health priority, as they are amongst the leading causes of burden of disease in low and middle-income countries. The comparison between the two cities regarding patterns of violence and psychiatric morbidity suggests that environmental factors may buffer the negative impacts of traumatic events. Identifying such factors might guide the implementation of interventions to improve mental health and quality of life in LMIC urban centers.},

abstract = {We develop fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with convex penalties. The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multinomial regression problems while the penalties include l1 (the lasso), l2 (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},
