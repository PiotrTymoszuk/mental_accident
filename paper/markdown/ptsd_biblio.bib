abstract = {There is broad interest in predicting the clinical course of mental disorders from early, multimodal clinical and biological information. Current computational models, however, constitute a significant barrier to realizing this goal. The early identification of trauma survivors at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is plausible given the disorder's salient onset and the abundance of putative biological and clinical risk indicators. This work evaluates the ability of Machine Learning (ML) forecasting approaches to identify and integrate a panel of unique predictive characteristics and determine their accuracy in forecasting non-remitting PTSD from information collected within10 days of a traumatic event. Data on event characteristics, emergency department observations, and early symptoms were collected in 957 trauma survivors, followed for fifteen months. An ML feature selection algorithm identified a set of predictors that rendered all others redundant. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as well as other ML classification algorithms were used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of i) ML selected features, ii) all available features without selection, and iii) Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) symptoms alone. SVM also compared the prediction of a) PTSD diagnostic status at 15 months to b) posterior probability of membership in an empirically derived non-remitting PTSD symptom trajectory. Results are expressed as mean Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC). The feature selection algorithm identified 16 predictors, present in ≥95% cross-validation trials. The accuracy of predicting non-remitting PTSD from that set (AUC=77) did not differ from predicting from all available information (AUC=78). Predicting from ASD symptoms was not better then chance (AUC=60). The prediction of PTSD status was less accurate than that of membership in a non-remitting trajectory (AUC=71). ML methods may fill a critical gap in forecasting PTSD. The ability to identify and integrate unique risk indicators makes this a promising approach for developing algorithms that infer probabilistic risk of chronic posttraumatic stress psychopathology based on complex sources of biological, psychological, and social information.},

abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in a substantial minority of emergency room admits. Inexpensive and accurate person-level assessment of PTSD risk after trauma exposure is a critical precursor to large-scale deployment of early interventions that may reduce individual suffering and societal costs. Toward this aim, we applied ensemble machine learning to predict PTSD screening status three months after severe injury using cost-effective and minimally invasive data. Participants (N = 271) were recruited at a Level 1 Trauma Center where they provided variables routinely collected at the hospital, including pulse, injury severity, and demographics, as well as psychological variables, including self-reported current depression, psychiatric history, and social support. Participant zip codes were used to extract contextual variables including population total and density, average annual income, and health insurance coverage rates from publicly available U.S. Census data. Machine learning yielded good prediction of PTSD screening status 3 months post-hospitalization, AUC = 0.85 95% CI [0.83, 0.86], and significantly outperformed all benchmark comparison models in a cross-validation procedure designed to yield an unbiased estimate of performance. These results demonstrate that good prediction can be attained from variables that individually have relatively weak predictive value, pointing to the promise of ensemble machine learning approaches that do not rely on strong isolated risk factors.},

abstract = {Background: The proportion of patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that remain undiagnosed may be substantial. Without an accurate diagnosis, these patients may lack PTSD-targeted treatments and experience adverse health outcomes. This study used a machine learning approach to identify and describe civilian patients likely to have undiagnosed PTSD in the US commercial population. Methods: The IBM{\textregistered} MarketScan{\textregistered} Commercial Subset (10/01/2015–12/31/2018) was used. A random forest machine learning model was developed and trained to differentiate between patients with and without PTSD using non–trauma-based features. The model was applied to patients for whom PTSD status could not be confirmed to identify individuals likely and unlikely to have undiagnosed PTSD. Patient characteristics, symptoms and complications potentially related to PTSD, treatments received, healthcare costs, and healthcare resource utilization were described separately for patients with PTSD (Actual Positive PTSD cohort), patients likely to have PTSD (Likely PTSD cohort), and patients without PTSD (Without PTSD cohort). Results: A total of 44,342 patients were classified in the Actual Positive PTSD cohort, 5683 in the Likely PTSD cohort, and 2,074,471 in the Without PTSD cohort. While several symptoms/comorbidities were similar between the Actual Positive and Likely PTSD cohorts, others, including depression and anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts/actions, and substance use, were more common in the Likely PTSD cohort, suggesting that certain symptoms may be exacerbated among those without a formal diagnosis. Mean per-patient-per-6-month healthcare costs were similar between the Actual Positive and Likely PTSD cohorts ($11,156 and $11,723) and were higher than those of the Without PTSD cohort ($3616); however, cost drivers differed between cohorts, with the Likely PTSD cohort experiencing more inpatient admissions and less outpatient visits than the Actual Positive PTSD cohort. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the lack of a PTSD diagnosis and targeted management of PTSD may result in a greater burden among undiagnosed patients and highlights the need for increased awareness of PTSD in clinical practice and among the civilian population.},

abstract = {Age differences in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are widely researched, but findings remain inconclusive. The mixed findings may in part result from sampling participants exposed to different trauma types at different times. Here, we controlled for this issue by sampling participants exposed to the same devastating hurricane. A total of 1.5 months after Hurricane Florence (T1), we asked 174 adults living in two severely affected states to describe their hurricane experience and fill in measures of PTSD and event centrality. Then, 7 months after the hurricane (T2), participants were reinvited to the survey, and 98 filled in the same questionnaire. The hurricane descriptions were coded for level of exposure severity. When controlling for trauma characteristics, including level of severity, younger age significantly predicted PTSD at T1 but not T2. When also controlling for event centrality, younger age predicted PTSD at both measurement times. Moreover, from T1 to T2, young adults significantly increased how severely they described their hurricane experience to be, whereas such amplification was absent in the older age groups. Overall, the findings provide some evidence that younger age increase vulnerability for PTSD and increase the perception of trauma severity over time},

abstract = {Purpose of Review: Sex differences in PTSD are well-established with a 2:1 sex ratio favouring women. Less well-established is the basis of such differences. The purpose of this review is to explore recent research examining potential gender- and sex-based contributors to sex differences in PTSD. Recent Findings: We identified 19 studies published since 2015. Masculinity is inconclusively associated with PTSD, but masculine ideals and masculine gender role stress are positively associated with PTSD. Among the sex-related factors, testosterone, oestradiol, progesterone, and ALLO/5$\alpha$-progesterone ratio are believed to be involved in the development of PTSD. These factors likely affect PTSD risk directly and through epigenetic mechanisms. Summary: Findings suggest that gender and sex have multiple ways of affecting PTSD, including gender roles, genetic predisposition, and hormonal influences. These factors work together to put women at a particular risk of developing PTSD. By conducting more research, we may improve prediction, prevention, and treatment of PTSD.},

abstract = {Purpose: We sought to estimate the pooled current prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among rescue workers and to determine the variables implicated in the heterogeneity observed among the prevalences of individual studies. Methods: A systematic review covering studies reporting on the PTSD prevalence in rescue teams was conducted following four sequential steps: (1) research in specialized online databases, (2) review of abstracts and selection of studies, (3) review of reference list, and (4) contact with authors and experts. Prevalence data from all studies were pooled using random effects model. Multivariate metaregression models were fitted to identify variables related to the prevalences heterogeneity. Results: A total of 28 studies, reporting on 40 samples with 20,424 rescuers, were selected. The worldwide pooled current prevalence was 10%. Meta-regression modeling in studies carried out in the Asian continent had, on average, higher estimated prevalences than those from Europe, but not higher than the North American estimates. Studies of ambulance personnel also showed higher estimated PTSD prevalence than studies with firefighters and police officers. Conclusions: Rescue workers in general have a pooled current prevalence of PTSD that is much higher than that of the general population. Ambulance personnel and rescuers from Asia may be more susceptible to PTSD. These results indicate the need for improving pre-employment strategies to select the most resilient individuals for rescue work, to implement continuous preventive measures for personnel, and to promote educational campaigns about PTSD and its therapeutic possibilities. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract = {Context: Traumatic events are common and are related to psychiatric impairment in childhood. Little is known about the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across different types of trauma exposure in children. Objective: To examine the developmental epidemiology of potential trauma and posttraumatic stress (PTS) in a longitudinal community sample of children. Methods: A representative population sample of 1420 children aged 9, 11, and 13 years at intake were followed up annually through 16 years of age. Main Outcome Measure: Traumatic events and PTS were assessed from child and parent reports annually to 16 years of age. Risk factors and DSM-IV disorders were also assessed. Results: More than two thirds of children reported at least 1 traumatic event by 16 years of age, with 13.4% of those children developing some PTS symptoms. Few PTS symptoms or psychiatric disorders were observed for individuals experiencing their first event, and any effects were short-lived. Less than 0.5% of children met the criteria for full-blown DSM-IV PTSD. Violent or sexual trauma were associated with the highest rates of symptoms. The PTS symptoms were predicted by previous exposure to multiple traumas, anxiety disorders, and family adversity. Lifetime co-occurrence of other psychiatric disorders with traumatic events and PTS symptoms was high, with the highest rates for anxiety and depressive disorders. Conclusions: In the general population of children, potentially traumatic events are fairly common and do not often result in PTS symptoms, except after multiple traumas or a history of anxiety. The prognosis after the first lifetime trauma exposure was generally favorable. Apart from PTSD, traumatic events are related to many forms of psychopathology, with the strongest links being with anxiety and depressive disorders. {\textcopyright}2007 American Medical Association.

Regular physical activity (PA) in an outdoor environment, like mountain exercising, might reduce psychological distress. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to assess the prevalence of mental health problems in mountain exercisers and to detect factors associated with psychological distress. In a cross-sectional design, we collected self-reported data of 1,536 Austrian mountain exercisers. The prevalence of mental health problems and psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale), the level of PA International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and affective valence during PA (Feeling Scale) were obtained. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to assess factors influencing psychological distress. The prevalence of mental health problems in Austrian mountain exercisers was 14%. Health-enhancing PA level and higher affective valence during PA were significantly associated with lower psychological distress. Minimal PA level was not significantly associated with lower psychological distress compared to inactive PA level. Marital status, education, alpine association membership, and body mass index did not show a significant influence on psychological distress. The prevalence of mental health problems seems to be lower in Austrian mountain exercisers compared to the European population. A health-enhancing PA level and affective valence increasing forms of PA were shown to be associated with lower psychological distress. Results might lead to interventional studies focusing on the potential of outdoor PA, e.g., mountain exercise, as an adjunct treatment in people at risk or with mental health problems.},

abstract = {Alpine sport is a popular form of exercise and provides several skills that are potentially relevant for positive development during adolescence. However, empirical data on differences between alpine and non-alpine sport participants in variables related to developmental changes are lacking. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to analyze differences in self-esteem and additional variables between adolescent alpine and non-alpine sport participants. A comparison to non-regular exercisers was conducted for self-esteem. In a cross-sectional design, information on self-esteem, sensation seeking, agency, and emotion regulation was collected in 183 adolescents [(mean age: 15.4 (SD: 2.3) years, 71.0% female)]. Alpine sport participants reported significantly higher self-esteem compared to non-regular exercisers, p = 0.003, d = 0.95, but not compared to non-alpine sport participants, p = 0.774, d = 0.06. When controlling for sex and high-risk sport engagement, alpine sport participants showed a significantly higher experience of agency compared to non-alpine sport participants, p = 0.016, d = 0.46. We conclude that alpine sport participation is less relevant with regard to self-esteem compared to regular exercise. However, the characteristics of alpine sport might provide a trigger for higher experience of agency during sport participation, potentially helping to satisfy the increased need for autonomy and independence in adolescence.},

abstract = {Common knowledge implies that individuals engaging in outdoor sports and especially in regular and extreme mountaineering are exceptionally healthy and hardened. Physical activity in outdoor environments has a positive effect on physical and mental health. However, regular and/or extreme mountaineering might share similarities with behavioural addictions and could thus also have a negative impact on health. In this cross-sectional web-based questionnaire study, we collected data on exercise and mountaineering addiction (Exercise Addiction Inventory; original and adapted version for mountaineering; Exercise Dependence Scale adapted version for mountaineering). Further surveyed parameters included mountaineering habits, Risk-Taking Inventory, Sensation-Seeking/Emotion Regulation/Agency Scale (SEAS), resilience, self-perceived stress, physical activity in metabolic units and mental health. Comparisons were performed between individuals with symptoms of addiction to mountaineering (MA) and individuals without symptoms of addiction to mountaineering or sports in general (CO) using non-parametric analyses. We analysed data from 335 participants, n = 88 thereof with addiction to mountaineering (MA) and n = 247 control participants (CO). The MA group scored significantly higher with regards to self-perceived stress (p < 0.001) and included a significantly higher number of individuals affected by symptoms of depression (p < 0.001), symptoms of anxiety (p < 0.001), symptoms of eating disorders (p < 0.001), alcohol abuse or dependence (p < 0.001), illicit drug abuse (p = 0.050), or current and history of psychiatric disorders (p < 0.001). Individuals with MA showed higher values in all SEAS subscales as well as increased risk-taking (p < 0.001). Regular and extreme mountaineering can display features of a behavioural addiction and is associated with psychiatric disorders. Behavioural addiction in mountaineering is associated with higher levels of sensation-seeking, emotion regulation, and agency, as well as increased risk-taking.},

abstract = {To date, no study has investigated the effects of avalanches on survivor's health beyond the first years. The aim of this study was to examine long-term health status 16 years after exposure to avalanches using a matched cohort design. Mental health, sleep quality and somatic symptoms among avalanche survivors (n= 286) and non-exposed controls (n= 357) were examined. Results showed that 16% of survivors currently experience avalanche-specific PTSD symptoms (PDS score. >. 14). In addition, survivors presented with increased risk of PTSD hyperarousal symptoms (>85th percentile) (aRR. = 1.83; 98.3% CI [1.23-2.74]); sleep-related problems (PSQI score. >. 5) (aRR. = 1.34; 95% CI [1.05-1.70]); PTSD-related sleep disturbances (PSQI-A score. ≥. 4) (aRR. = 1.86; 95% CI [1.30-2.67]); musculoskeletal and nervous system problems (aRR 1.43; 99% CI 1.06-1.93) and gastrointestinal problems (aRR 2.16; 99% CI 1.21-3.86) compared to the unexposed group. Results highlight the need for treatment for long-term PTSD symptoms and sleep disruption in disaster communities.},

abstract = {Background: As any traumatic event, avalanches could trigger psychological disorders on survivors. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among avalanche survivors and to evaluate post-traumatic stress disorder risks factors as well as the impact on quality of life. Methods: A multicentre study was conducted in victims included in the North Alpine Avalanche Registry from 2014 to 2018. Data were collected through a standard questionnaire during semi-directed phone interviews. The primary outcome was the total score on the Impact of Event Scale Revised. Secondary outcomes were the Mental Component Scale and the Physical Component Scale scores of the Short Form 12 questionnaire. Results: During the study period, 132 of 211 victims survived. Among the 107 victims included, 55 (51.4%) phone interviews were obtained. Six patients (10.9, 95% CI 1.76–20.05) had an Impact of Event Scale Revised score ≥ 33 indicating a strong probability for post-traumatic stress disorder. Median Mental Component Scale score was 39.0 (IQR 30.5–46.3) for post-traumatic stress disorder patients and 40.1 (IQR 36.5–43.4) for non post-traumatic stress disorder (p = 0.76). Median Physical Component Scale score was 39.4 (37.2–44.3) for post-traumatic stress disorder patients and 44.2 (39.1–46.8) for non post-traumatic stress disorder (p = 0.39). No significant difference in the quality of life in both populations was observed, and no independent risk factors of post-traumatic stress disorder was identified. Conclusion: Avalanche accidents may induce post-traumatic stress disorders among survivors in a comparable prevalence to the most traumatic event already studied. Early recognition and preventive measures should be set up in order to reduce the psychological burden in these victims. Trial registration: NCT03936738.},

abstract = {Despite their high level of exposure to potential traumatic events (TE), the prevalence rate of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among mountain workers was reported as particularly low (Sommer & Ehlert, 2004) although the high exposure of these professionals to TE. This study aimed to estimate the magnitude of PTSD rate in mountain workers once we used a cover story to reduce sample bias. Mountain workers underwent either clinical interviews by means of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (n=60) or they self-reported their symptoms by means of an appropriate questionnaire of the PTSD Check List (PCL) (n=73). We also estimated the magnitude of PTSD rate by the means of meta-analysis. A discrepancy in the PTSD rate was observed as a function of the method used for the diagnosis [i.e., the interview method (22%) or the self-report method (5%)]. Furthermore, the meta-analysis shows that the overall estimation of PTSD varies and lies between 2.79% and 5.93% among this specific population with multiple exposures (range from 64% to 96% for exposure at least one TE). Our results are congruent with higher PTSD rates observed with other at-risk professionals. The present study reveals that mountains workers are frequently exposed to TE and according to the method of diagnosis the prevalence rate may present huge variations. This major finding points out the necessity to pay attention to the method used when the PTSD prevalence is estimated in the case of multiple exposure and among occupational population.},

abstract = {Objective: The present study aimed to assess the frequency of trauma exposure, the prevalence of possible post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the extent of resilience, and sense of coherence among personnel of the Swiss alpine rescue association (ARS). Methods: Using a trilingual online survey approach, 465 mountain rescuers of the ARS were surveyed using the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL-5), the Resilience Scale 13 and 14 (RS-13/-14), the Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS-10), the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12), the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Sense of Coherence Scale 13 (SOC-13), and the Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS). Results: Although the rate of mountain rescuers having witnessed or experienced a traumatic event was high (71%), the prevalence of possible PTSD was low (0.9%). The sample showed high resilience and high sense of coherence. Resilience was positively correlated with work experience. Low perceived stress and high sense of coherence predicted resilience. The severity of PTSD symptoms was mainly predicted by low sense of coherence. Sense of coherence mediated the interaction between resilience and severity of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: The findings suggest that resilience and sense of coherence are indicative for the low prevalence of possible PTSD among mountain rescuers, and may therefore represent valuable screening and training parameters for mountain rescue personnel.},

Method All mountain guides (n=1347) were surveyed using of the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), and the Sense of Coherence Self-Rating Scale (SOC-29). Results Although Swiss mountain guides are exposed to many traumatic situations, the prevalence rate of PTSD is very low (2.7%), and their SOC total scores are high (157.9±18.4). Subgroups differentiated by the extent of traumatic stress symptoms differ significantly in SOC and GHQ total scores. Regression analysis showed SOC total score to be a significant predictor, although it only accounted for 1% of the variance in the number of PTSD symptoms endorsed. Conclusion The low prevalence rate of PTSD is not in line with findings in other high-risk populations for PTSD. SOC seems to be a marker for psychological health rather than a protective factor against PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective:To determine the prevalence of positive screening for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) amongst trauma patients. Design(s):Prospective, longitudinal study. Setting(s):Single urban US level 1 trauma center.Patients and methods:Four hundred fifty-two adult trauma patients were administered the PTSD checklist for DSM-V (PCL-5) survey upon posthospital outpatient clinic visit. This included 300 men (66%) and 152 women with mean age 43.8 years and mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) 11.3, with 83% having fractures of the pelvis and/or extremities. Medical and injury related variables were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of screening positive for PTSD.Main outcome measurement:Prevalence and risk factors for screening positive for PTSD amongst the trauma patient population. Result(s):Twenty-six percent of trauma patients screened positive for PTSD after mean 86 days following injury. These patients were younger (35 vs 46 years old, P < 0.001) and more commonly African American (56% vs 43% Caucasian, P < 0.001). Pedestrians struck by motor vehicles (OR 4.70, P = 0.040) and victims of crime (OR 4.12, P = 0.013) were more likely to screen positive. Psychiatric history, injury severity (ISS), and injury type did not predict positive screening. Conclusion(s):One-in-four patients suffering traumatic injuries screened positive for PTSD suggesting the prevalence of PTSD among trauma patients far exceeds that of the general population. Predictive factors included victims of crime and pedestrians struck by motor vehicles. Screening measures are needed in orthopaedic trauma surgery clinics to refer these at-risk patients for proper evaluation and treatment.

About 75% of all falls hap-pened during the descent and 70% of the victims who sustained a fall-related injury showed defective vision. Mountain hikers should pay attention to sufficient regeneration before and breaks during descending. Additionally, a regular check of visual aids (glasses, contact lenses) can be recommended. › In recreational alpine skiing, the injury rate is estimated to be less than 1 injury per 1000 skier days and the traumatic fatality rate amounts to 0.36 traumatic deaths per million skier days. A tear of the anterior cruciate ligament is the most com-mon diagnosis with about 15-21% of all injuries and the risk is 3 times higher in women than in men.

abstract = {Introduction: Affective responses during physical activity (PA) are important for engagement in PA programs and for adherence to a physically active lifestyle. Little is known about the affective responses to PA bouts lasting longer than 45 minutes. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to analyse acute effects on affective responses of a three-hour outdoor PA intervention (mountain hiking) compared to a sedentary control situation and to an indoor treadmill condition. Methods: Using a randomized crossover design, 42 healthy participants were randomly exposed to three different conditions: outdoor mountain hiking, indoor treadmill walking, and sedentary control situation (approximately three hours each). Measures included the Feeling Scale, Felt Arousal Scale and a Mood Survey Scale. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to analyse differences between the conditions. Results: Compared to the control situation, the participants showed a significant increase in affective valence (d = 1.21, p < .001), activation (d = 0.81, p = .004), elation (d = 1.07, p < .001), and calmness (d = 0.84, p = .004), and a significant decrease in fatigue (d = -1.19, p < .001) and anxiety (d = -.79, p < .001) after mountain hiking. Outdoor mountain hiking showed significantly greater positive effects on affective valence, activation, and fatigue compared to indoor treadmill walking. Discussion: The results indicate that a three-hour PA intervention (mountain hiking) elicits higher positive and lower negative affective responses compared to a sedentary control situation and to an indoor PA condition. Outdoor mountain hiking can be recommended by health professionals as a form of PA with the potential to positively influence affective responses.

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a global health issue, with prevalence rates ranging from 1.3% to 37.4%. As there is little current data on PTSD in Canada, an epidemiological study was conducted examining PTSD and related comorbid conditions. Modified versions of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) PTSD module, the depression, alcohol and substance abuse sections of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), as well as portions of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were combined, and administered via telephone interview in English or French. Random digit dialing was used to obtain a nationally representative sample of 2991, aged 18 years and above from across Canada. The prevalence rate of lifetime PTSD in Canada was estimated to be 9.2%, with a rate of current (1-month) PTSD of 2.4%. Traumatic exposure to at least one event sufficient to cause PTSD was reported by 76.1% of respondents. The most common forms of trauma resulting in PTSD included unexpected death of a loved one, sexual assault, and seeing someone badly injured or killed. In respondents meeting criteria for PTSD, the symptoms were chronic in nature, and associated with significant impairment and high rates of comorbidity. PTSD is a common psychiatric disorder in Canada. The results are surprising, given the comparably low rates of violent crime, a small military and few natural disasters. Potential implications of these findings are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Context: Little is known about lifetime prevalence or age of onset of DSM-IV disorders. Objective: To estimate lifetime prevalence and age-ofonset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication. Design and Setting: Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 using the fully structured World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Participants: Nine thousand two hundred eighty-two English-speaking respondents aged 18 years and older. Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse-control, and substance use disorders. Results: Lifetime prevalence estimates are as follows: anxiety disorders, 28.8%; mood disorders, 20.8%; impulse-control disorders, 24.8%; substance use disorders, 14.6%; any disorder, 46.4%. Median age of onset is much earlier for anxiety (11 years) and impulse-control (11 years) disorders than for substance use (20 years) and mood (30 years) disorders. Half of all lifetime cases start by age 14 years and three fourths by age 24 years. Later onsets are mostly of comorbid conditions, with estimated lifetime risk of any disorder at age 75 years (50.8%) only slightly higher than observed lifetime prevalence (46.4%). Lifetime prevalence estimates are higher in recent cohorts than in earlier cohorts and have fairly stable intercohort differences across the life course that vary in substantively plausible ways among sociodemographic subgroups. Conclusions: About half of Americans will meet the criteria for a DSM-IV disorder sometime in their life, with first onset usually in childhood or adolescence.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Considerable research has documented that exposure to traumatic events has negative effects on physical and mental health. Much less research has examined the predictors of traumatic event exposure. Increased understanding of risk factors for exposure to traumatic events could be of considerable value in targeting preventive interventions and anticipating service needs.
METHOD: General population surveys in 24 countries with a combined sample of 68 894 adult respondents across six continents assessed exposure to 29 traumatic event types. Differences in prevalence were examined with cross-tabulations. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine whether traumatic event types clustered into interpretable factors. Survival analysis was carried out to examine associations of sociodemographic characteristics and prior traumatic events with subsequent exposure.
RESULTS: Over 70% of respondents reported a traumatic event; 30.5% were exposed to four or more. Five types - witnessing death or serious injury, the unexpected death of a loved one, being mugged, being in a life-threatening automobile accident, and experiencing a life-threatening illness or injury - accounted for over half of all exposures. Exposure varied by country, sociodemographics and history of prior traumatic events. Being married was the most consistent protective factor. Exposure to interpersonal violence had the strongest associations with subsequent traumatic events.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the near ubiquity of exposure, limited resources may best be dedicated to those that are more likely to be further exposed such as victims of interpersonal violence. Identifying mechanisms that account for the associations of prior interpersonal violence with subsequent trauma is critical to develop interventions to prevent revictimization.},

abstract = {We estimate the cumulative occurrence of traumatic events and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria, in a high-risk sample of young people in urban United States. The epidemiological sample (n = 2,311) was recruited in 1985-1986 at entry into first grade of a public school system of a large mid-Atlantic city. Participants were interviewed about history of trauma and PTSD in 2000-2002 when their mean age was 21 years (n = 1,698). We found that the lifetime occurrence of assaultive violence was 62.6% in males and 33.7% in females. The risk of assaultive violence in males (but not females) varied by childhood area of residence within the city; the occurrence of other traumas did not vary by area of childhood residence. Females had a higher risk of PTSD than males following assaultive violence (odds ratio = 4.0, 95% confidence interval 2.0-8.3), but not following other traumas. A comparison of the results from this largely inner-city sample with the results from a recent study of a largely suburban sample in another region of the United States in which the same criteria and measures of trauma and PTSD were used suggested the possibility that males' risk for assaultive violence and females' risk for PTSD following exposure to assaultive violence might vary by characteristics of the social environment.},

@article{Seedat2005,
abstract = {Although women are exposed to proportionately fewer traumatic events in their lifetime than men, they have a higher lifetime risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition to gender-differential rates of rape and sexual assault, including greater exposure to intimate partner violence, the preponderance of PTSD in women may be attributable to factors other than trauma type, such as sensitisation of stress hormone systems in response to early adverse experiences, inherent neuroendocrine factors, subjective interpretation of the event, and peritraumatic dissociation. Women with PTSD arguably experience a greater symptom burden, longer course of illness and have worse quality-of-life outcomes than men. An expanding knowledge base of the psychobiological alterations in PTSD is providing stimulus for the development of improved pharmacological and psychosocial treatment options. Recent randomised controlled studies conducted in large samples of women with chronic PTSD indicate that: (i) SSRIs have efficacy on all three symptom clusters of PTSD and should be used as first-line pharmacotherapy; and (ii) cognitive behavioural strategies (e.g. prolonged exposure treatment and cognitive processing) are effective in sexually and non-sexually assaulted women. Studies also suggest that female gender may be associated with better response rates to pharmacotherapy. Emerging empirical data on the potential usefulness of antiadrenergic agents and preventive cognitive behavioural treatments in managing acute trauma reactions and stemming the emergence of PTSD are paving the way for further work in this area. However, additional innovative treatments are needed for traumatised women and for female children/adolescents presenting with acute stress reactions and PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

@article{Bryant2019,
abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM-III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up-to-date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence-supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best-validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two-thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence-based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.},

@article{Howie2019,
abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a syndrome which serves as a classic example of psychiatric disorders that result from the intersection of nature and nurture, or gene and environment. By definition, PTSD requires the experience of a traumatic exposure, and yet data suggest that the risk for PTSD in the aftermath of trauma also has a heritable (genetic) component. Thus, PTSD appears to require both a biological (genetic) predisposition that differentially alters how the individual responds to or recovers from trauma exposure. Epigenetics is defined as the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself, and more recently it has come to refer to direct alteration of DNA regulation, but without altering the primary sequence of DNA, or the genetic code. With regards to PTSD, epigenetics provides one way for environmental exposure to be “written” upon the genome, as a direct result of gene and environment (trauma) interactions. This review provides an overview of the main currently understood types of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, histone regulation of chromatin, and noncoding RNA regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, we examine recent literature related to how these methods of epigenetic regulation may be involved in differential risk and resilience for PTSD in the aftermath of trauma.},

abstract = {Background: Survey research including multiple health indicators requires brief indices for use in cross-cultural studies, which have, however, rarely been tested in terms of their psychometric quality. Recently, the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index was developed as an adaptation of the WHOQOL-100 and the WHOQOL-BREF. The aim of the current study was to test the psychometric properties of the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index. Methods: In a survey on 4849 European adults, the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index was assessed across 10 countries, with equal samples adjusted for selected sociodemographic data. Participants were also investigated with a chronic condition checklist, measures on general health perception, mental health, health-care utilization and social support. Results: Findings indicated good internal consistencies across a range of countries, showing acceptable convergent validity with physical and mental health measures, and the measure discriminates well between individuals that report having a longstanding condition and healthy individuals across all countries. Differential item functioning was less frequently observed in those countries that were geographically and culturally closer to the UK, but acceptable across all countries. A universal one-factor structure with a good fit in structural equation modelling analyses (SEM) was identified with, however, limitations in model fit for specific countires. Conclusions: The short EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index showed good cross-cultural field study performance and a satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity, and can therefore be recommended for use in public health research. In future studies the measure should also be tested in multinational clinical studies, particularly in order to test its sensitivity. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

A principal component factor analysis did not identify the 3-factor structure of the SOC-Scale. It appears that the best solution consists of one global factor. The newly developed SOC-L9, conceptualized as an unidimensional scale, is a reliable and valid instrument, which allows to assess the SOC economically. In our study the Sense of Coherence depended on age and gender. Women and older people reported a lower SOC. Furthermore we found significant associations between SOC and different subjective health measures. A high SOC was associated with both a lower extent of subjective body complaints and somatoform symptoms and with minor health-related problems in daily living.},

abstract = {Background Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity. Methods A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use. Results A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89%) and specificity (82%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale. Conclusion The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.},

A subsample of these participants (n = 140) was used to define a valid diagnostic cutoff score for the instrument using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5; Weathers, Blake, et al., 2013) as the reference standard. The PCL-5 test scores demonstrated good internal consistency (a =. 96), test-retest reliability (r =. 84), and convergent and discriminant validity. Consistent with previous studies (Armour et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014), confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the data were best explained by a 6-factor anhedonia model and a 7-factor hybrid model. Signal detection analyses using the CAPS-5 revealed that PCL-5 scores of 31 to 33 were optimally efficient for diagnosing PTSD (k(.5) =. 58). Overall, the findings suggest that the PCL-5 is a psychometrically sound instrument that can be used effectively with veterans. Further, by determining a valid cutoff score using the CAPS-5, the PCL-5 can now be used to identify veterans with probable PTSD. However, findings also suggest the need for research to evaluate cluster structure of DSM-5.},

Aims To study the relationship between traumatic events and prevalence of mental disorders in S{\~{a}}o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Methods Cross-sectional survey carried out in 2007–2008 with a probabilistic representative sample of 15- to 75-year-old residents in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.  Results The sample comprised 3744 interviews. Nearly 90% of participants faced lifetime traumatic events. Lifetime prevalence of any disorders was 44% in Sao Paulo and 42.1% in Rio de Janeiro. One-year estimates were 32.5% and 31.2%. One-year prevalence of traumatic events was higher in Rio de Janeiro than Sao Paulo (35.1 vs. 21.7; p<0.001). Participants from Rio de Janeiro were less likely to have alcohol dependence (OR = 0.55; p = 0.027), depression (OR = 0.6; p = 0.006) generalized anxiety (OR = 0.59; p = 0.021) and post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 0.62; p = 0.027). Traumatic events correlated with all diagnoses – e.g. assaultive violence with alcohol dependence (OR = 5.7; p<0.001) and with depression (OR = 1.7; p = 0.001).  Conclusion Our findings show that psychiatric disorders and traumatic events, especially violence, are extremely common in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, supporting the idea that neuropsychiatric disorders and external causes have become a major public health priority, as they are amongst the leading causes of burden of disease in low and middle-income countries. The comparison between the two cities regarding patterns of violence and psychiatric morbidity suggests that environmental factors may buffer the negative impacts of traumatic events. Identifying such factors might guide the implementation of interventions to improve mental health and quality of life in LMIC urban centers.},

abstract = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown thai the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates.

abstract = {Recursive partitioning methods have become popular and widely used tools for nonparametric regression and classification in many scientific fields. Especially random forests, which can deal with large numbers of predictor variables even in the presence of complex interactions, have been applied successfully in genetics, clinical medicine, and bioinformatics within the past few years. High-dimensional problems are common not only in genetics, but also in some areas of psychological research, where only a few subjects can be measured because of time or cost constraints, yet a large amount of data is generated for each subject. Random forests have been shown to achieve a high prediction accuracy in such applications and to provide descriptive variable importance measures reflecting the impact of each variable in both main effects and interactions. The aim of this work is to introduce the principles of the standard recursive partitioning methods as well as recent methodological improvements, to illustrate their usage for low and high-dimensional data exploration, but also to point out limitations of the methods and potential pitfalls in their practical application. Application of the methods is illustrated with freely available implementations in the R system for statistical computing. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown presents a much easier way to write books and technical publications than traditional tools such as LaTeX and Word. The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C plus plus, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub.},

abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Such groupings need to be validated to separate the signal in the data from spurious structure. In this context, finding an appropriate number of clusters is a particularly important model selection question. We introduce a measure of cluster stability to assess the validity of a cluster model. This stability measure quantifies the reproducibility of clustering solutions on a second sample, and it can be interpreted as a classification risk with regard to class labels produced by a clustering algorithm. The preferred number of clusters is determined by minimizing this classification risk as a function of the number of clusters. Convincing results are achieved on simulated as well as gene expression data sets. Comparisons to other methods demonstrate the competitive performance of our method and its suitability as a general validation tool for clustering solutions in real-world problems.},

But the limited labeled data may be imbalanced and can not cover all clusters in some cases and most of the existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms can not deal with imbalanced dataset well and have no the ability of detecting new clusters. In view of this, an adaptive semi-supervised clustering algorithm with label propagation is proposed. Two most of interesting characteristics of the proposed algorithm are that (1) It uses the limited labeled data to expand labeled dataset based on an adaptive threshold by labeling their k-nearest neighbors, (2) It detects whether there exist new clusters in the unlabeled dataset according to a proposed measure criterion. Three standard datasets are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results confirm that the accuracy of the proposed clustering algorithm is much higher than that of three compared algorithm and in addition the proposed algorithm has the ability of detecting new clusters. {\textcopyright} 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

Two samples of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (ns = 90 and 140) provide evidence for the reliability and validity of the BRCS. The BRCS has adequate internal consistency and test-re test reliability. Convergent validity of the scale is demonstrated by predictable correlations with measures of personal coping resources (e.g.,-optimism, helplessness, self-efficacy), pain coping behaviors, and psychological well-being. Resilient coping, as assessed by the BRCS, also buffers the effects of high levels of arthritis-related and non-arthritis-related stressors on depressive symptoms. The sensitivity of the BRCS to changes associated with a cognitive-behavioral intervention is also demonstrated. The BCRS may be useful for identifying individuals in need of interventions designed to enhance resilient coping skills. {\textcopyright} 2004 Sage Publications.},

We summarized the psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 across a range of studies and cut-off scores to select the optimal cut-off for detecting depression. Methods: We searched Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO from 1999 to August 2010 for studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of PHQ-9 to diagnose major depressive disorders. We calculated summary sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios for detecting major depressive disorder at different cut-off scores and in different settings. We used random-effects bivariate meta-analysis at cut-off points between 7 and 15 to produce summary receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: We identified 18 validation studies (n = 7180) conducted in various clinical settings. Eleven studies provided details about the diagnostic properties of the questionnaire at more than one cut-off score (including 10), four studies reported a cut-off score of 10, and three studies reported cut-off scores other than 10. The pooled specificity results ranged from 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.82) for a cut-off score of 7 to 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97) for a cut-off score of 15. There was major variability in sensitivity for cut-off scores between 7 and 15. There were no substantial differences in the pooled sensitivity and specificity for a range of cut-off scores (8-11). Interpretation: The PHQ-9 was found to have acceptable diagnostic properties for detecting major depressive disorder for cut-off scores between 8 and 11. Authors of future validation studies should consistently report the outcomes for different cut-off scores. {\textcopyright} 2012 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.},

For the diagnosis of major depressive disorder, the PHQ showed excellent criterion validity (medical patients: sensitivity, 95%; specificity, 86%). Good operating characteristics were also found for the diagnosis of panic disorder. The use of the PHQ was well accepted by more than 90% of both physicians and patients. Overall, the PHQ is a valid, effective, and well accepted diagnostic tool for use in research and clinical practice.

abstract = {Objective: Somatization is prevalent in primary care and is associated with substantial functional impairment and healthcare utilization. However, instruments for identifying and monitoring somatic symptoms are few in number and not widely used. Therefore, we examined the validity of a brief measure of the severity of somatic symptoms. Methods: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders. The PHQ-15 comprises 15 somatic symptoms from the PHQ, each symptom scored from 0 ("not bothered at all") to 2 ("bothered a lot"). The PHQ-15 was administered to 6000 patients in eight general internal medicine and family practice clinics and seven obstetrics-gynecology clinics. Outcomes included functional status as assessed by the 20-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-20), self-reported sick days and clinic visits, and symptom-related difficulty. Results: As PHQ-15 somatic symptom severity increased, there was a substantial stepwise decrement in functional status on all six SF-20 subscales. Also, symptom-related difficulty, sick days, and healthcare utilization increased. PHQ-15 scores of 5, 10, 15, represented cutoff points for low, medium, and high somatic symptom severity, respectively. Somatic and depressive symptom severity had differential effects on outcomes. Results were similar in the primary care and obstetrics-gynecology samples. Conclusions: The PHQ-15 is a brief, self-administered questionnaire that may be useful in screening for somatization and in monitoring somatic symptom severity in clinical practice and research.},

abstract = {A computational toolbox for recursive partitioning. The core of the package is ctree(), an implementation of conditional inference trees which embed tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. This non-parametric class of regression trees is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Based on conditional inference trees, cforest() provides an implementation of Breiman's random forests. The function mob() implements an algorithm for recursive partitioning based on parametric models (e.g. linear models, GLMs or survival regression) employing parameter instability tests for split selection. Extensible functionality for visualizing tree-structured regression models is available. The methods are described in Hothorn et al. (2006) <doi:10.1198/106186006X133933>, Zeileis et al.

Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.},

Here, one projects the data on a lower-dimensional space such that a robust measure of variance of the projected data will be maximized. The Projection-Pursuit-based method for principal component analysis has recently been introduced in the field of chemometrics, where the number of variables is typically large. In this paper, it is shown that the currently available algorithm for robust Projection-Pursuit PCA performs poor in the presence of many variables. A new algorithm is proposed that is more suitable for the analysis of chemical data.

abstract = {Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids. In Euclidean geometry the mean—as used in k-means—is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second (“SWAP”) phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (while retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now explore faster intialization strategies. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications.},

abstract = {Comparison is a fundamental method of scientific research leading to insights about the processes that generate similarity or dissimilarity. In statistical terms comparisons between probability functions are performed to infer connections, correlations, or relationships between objects or samples (Cha 2007). Most quantification methods rely on distance or similarity measures, but the right choice for each individual application is not always clear and sometimes poorly explored. The reason for this is partly that diverse measures are either implemented in different R packages with very different notations or are not implemented at all. Thus, a comprehensive framework implementing the most common similarity and distance measures using a uniform notation is still missing. The R (R Core Team 2018) package Philentropy aims to fill this gap by implementing forty-six fundamental distance and similarity measures (Cha 2007) for comparing probability functions. These comparisons between probability functions have their foundations in a broad range of scientific disciplines from mathematics to ecology. The aim of this package is to provide a comprehensive and computationally optimized base framework for clustering, classification, statistical inference, goodness-of-fit, non-parametric statistics, information theory, and machine learning tasks that are based on comparing univariate or multivari-ate probability functions. All functions are written in C++ and are integrated into the R package using the Rcpp Application Programming Interface (API) (Eddelbuettel 2013). Together, this framework allows building new similarity or distance based (statistical) models and algorithms in R which are computationally efficient and scalable. The comprehensive availability of diverse metrics and measures furthermore enables a systematic assessment of choosing the most optimal similarity or distance measure for individual applications in diverse scientific disciplines. The following probability distance/similarity and information theory measures are implemented in Philentropy.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Results: We identify two mechanisms responsible for this finding: (i) A preference for the selection of correlated predictors in the tree building process and (ii) an additional advantage for correlated predictor variables induced by the unconditional permutation scheme that is employed in the computation of the variable importance measure. Based on these considerations we develop a new, conditional permutation scheme for the computation of the variable importance measure. Conclusion: The resulting conditional variable importance reflects the true impact of each predictor variable more reliably than the original marginal approach. {\textcopyright} 2008 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},
